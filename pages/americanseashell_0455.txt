as gabbi Tryon. Dead specimens are commonly washed ashore. Siphon 
studded with tiny, rounded flecks of chitinous material.

<tname>Pholas ca77ipechiensis Gmelin</tname> Campeche Angel AVing 

Plate 32t 

North Carolina to the Gulf States and Central America. 

3 to 4 inches in length, Mj as high, fragile, purc-\\iiite and closely resembling the False Angel Wing, <tname>Petricola pholadijonms</tname>, but lacking a 
toothed hinge and ligament, and having a glossy plate rolled over the beaks 



<tname>PHOLADIDAE</tname> 463 

which is supported by about a dozen, vertical, shelly plates. Not very common. 



Genus <tname>Xylophaga Turton 1822</tname> 
<tname>Xylophaga ivashingtona Bartsch</tname> Washington Wood-eater 

Washington and Oregon. 

% inch in length, globular and fragile. The large anterior gape has % 
of its area covered by a triangular callum in each upper and outer corner. 
Middle of inside of each valve reinforced by a small, strong, radial cord vi^hich 
is welded to the valve. Color yellowish white. Bores into pieces of waterlogged wood. Uncommonly collected in dredging hauls. 

The Atlantic species <tname>X. dorsalis Turton</tname> has much the same characters 
as the above species. It occurs from loo to 300 fathoms from the Arctic 
Seas to off Cape Cod. 

Genus <tname>Fenitella Valenciennes 1846</tname> 
<tname>PeJiitella penita Conrad</tname> Flap-tipped Piddock 

Bering Sea to San Diego, California. 

1 % to 3 inches in length, elongate to moderately short, rotund anteriorly, 
becoming compressed and narrow posteriorly where there is a leathery prolongation protecting the siphons. Anterior gape commonly closed by an 
eggshell-like, globose, callus plate which continues up on to the beak region 
in the form of a pair of rather large plates. Just in back of these there is a 
short, triangular plate or protoplax set on top of the middle of the dorsal 
region. Otherwise somewhat resembling the large <tname>Farapholas californica</tname>. 
Commonly found boring in rocks and shale. The form sagitta "Stearns" 
Dall lacks the calcareous covering over the foot gape. It is found with the 
typical form. 

Genus <tname>Fholadidea Turton 18 19</tname> 
<tname>Pholadidea ovoidea Gould</tname> Wart-necked Piddock 

Bering^ Sea to the Gulf of California. 

2 to 3 inches in length, very similar to pilsbryi, but oval in side view. 
About half of the anterior foot gape is covered by eggshell-like, smoothish 
calcareous material. It is not impossible that pilsbryi is an ecological form 
of this species. More studies in their natural history are needed. Moderately
