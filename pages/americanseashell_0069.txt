In most bivalves, the two valves are of the same size (equivahe), but in 
some genera one valve is larger and slightly overlaps the other (ineqjiivalve) . 
In <tname>Ostrea</tname>, <tname>Pandora</tname> and <tname>Lyonsia</tname>, the left valve is the larger; in <tname>Corbula</tname>, the 
right valve is the larger. A bivalve is said to be equilateral when the beak is 
midway between the anterior and posterior ends of the valve. Most bivalves, 
however, are inequilateral with the beak placed nearer one end. 

In many forms, the margins of the valves do not fit closely together, but 
have an opening called the gape somewhere along the margin. In the Softshelled Clam, <tname>My a</tname>, the gape is posterior ■and through it protrudes the siphon 
(siphonal gape); in <tname>Rocellaria</tname> it is anterior and large and serves for the

passage of the foot. Some clams, such as <tname>Soleii</tname> and <tname>Eiisis</tname>, gape at both ends. 
In <tname>Ar€a</tname> there is a small notch or opening on the ventral margin for the 
passage of the anchoring organ, the byssus. This is called the byssal notch. 

The ligament is a brown, horny band located above the hinge, and is 
generally posterior to the beaks. As a rule, the greater part of the ligament 
is externally placed on the shell, but in some genera it may be partially or 
entirely internal. The ligament consists of two distinct parts, which may 
occur together in the same species or separately in others — the ligament 
proper and the internal cartilage or resilmm. In most cases, the two portions 
are intimately connected with one another, but in some clams, such as <tname>My a</tname> 
and <tname>Mactra</tname>, the cartilage is entirely separate (the resilium) and is lodged 
within the hinge in a spoon-shaped chojidrophore. The external ligament is 
inelastic and insoluble in strong alkali (KOH). The cartilage is very elastic, 
slightly iridescent and soluble in KOH.
