I to i^ inches in length, short canal, deep suture, 5 or 6 whorls are 
shouldered above. Characterized by the flaring thin lip, brownish aperture, 
8 to 10 lamella-like ribs per whorl, and weak microscopic spiral threads. 
Moderately common; littoral in Alaska, 10 to 30 fathoms in Puget Sound.

Alaska to San Diego, California. 

2 inches in length, waxy texture, pure-white to yellow-cream, with 9 
to 1 1 strong, lamella-like, high-shoulder ribs per each of the 7 whorls. Whorls 
in spire cancellated by the 2- or 3 -spiral raised cords. Body whorl with 5 
very weak spiral rounded threads. <tname>B. s?mthi Dall</tname> is the same. Uncommon

Alaska to off Lower California. 

% to I inch in length, similar to multicostatiis, with the spire % the 
length of the shell, canal twice as long, with 12 to 14 ribs which are shouldered further below the suture. Suture slightly indented. Fairly common at 
low tide in Alaska. Occurs in very deep water farther south.

Arctic Ocean to Fuca Strait, Washington 

2 inches in length, spire /4 and canal nearly 34 the length of the shell. 
5 whorls globose, crowned at the shoulder with 12 to 20 short spines per 
whorl. The ribs over the whorl are moderately to obsoletely developed. 
Rare in about 30 to 50 fathoms.

Monterey to San Pedro, California. 

Nearly i inch in length, 7 whorls, with 8 delicate axial ribs which bear 
rather short erect protuberances on the shoulder. Nuclear whorl smooth, 
followed by squarish whorls which bear ribs from suture to suture, and which 
are smooth in between. Siphonal canal rather short. Grayish white with 
enamel-white aperture. <tname>B. peregrimis Dall</tname> is the same. Formerly confused 
with <tname>Forreria (Austrotrophon) cerrosensis cerrosensis</tname> and its form, p'mnatiis
