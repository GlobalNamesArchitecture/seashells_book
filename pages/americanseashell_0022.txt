the foot of this snail are flapped up and down much in the manner of a bat

However, the pelagic habitat and the ability to swim are the exception 
among the snails. The intertidal zone which is intermittently flooded and 
drained by the moving tides is well stocked with many kinds of creeping 
snails. <tname>Adany Nassarius</tname> Mud Snails live exclusively on the warm, flat mudFiGURE 3. a, The Nassa Mud Snail, <tname>Nassarius</tname>, crawling under the sand with its

bars of quiet bays. Among the carnivorous snails, we find that their ecologic 
stations are determined by the location of the worms or bivalves upon which 
they feed. One or two species of <tname>Terebra</tname> and <tname>Polinices</tname> Moon Shell are found 
burrowing in the sand of beach slopes where they are able to find their favorite clams, but the majority of these snail genera are found from low-tide mark 
to a depth of several fathoms. Since most marine gastropods are nocturnal in 
habit and shun bright sunlight, many species spend their time hidden in crevices under rocks. This affords protection to themselves and their eggs from 
predators, bright sun and violent wave action. 

A great number of species live in deep water, and frequently their vertical distribution is limited to relatively narrow ranges. From some 500 dredging samples taken off southeastern Florida by the late J. B. Henderson's yacht 
"Eolis," Bayer's Dwarf Olive (<tname>Olivella bayeri</tname>) was found in depths ranging 
from 25 to 115 fathoms. On the other hand, the Greenland Moon Shell has 
been found from twelve feet to over two miles in depth. 

In their experimental search for new living places, a few gastropods have 
evolved strange associations with other marine animals. Tlie dwarf <tname>CyphoLife of the Snails 19

eaten into the ascidian in which the female snail deposits her flask-shaped egg 
capsules (fig. 9). Among the <tname>Eulima</tname> and tiny <tname>Pyram</tname> snails there are many 
species which parasitize sea urchins and certain kinds of clams. Several species of <tname>Sty lifer</tname> live embedded in the flesh of starfish, and only a wart-like

of a modified, syringe-like snout.
