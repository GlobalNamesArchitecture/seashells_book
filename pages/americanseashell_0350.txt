/4 to I inch in length, obtusely carinate, with numerous coarse, beaded, 
radial ribs which bifurcate. Color brownish purple on the dorsal half, strawyellow to brownish yellow on the flattened ventral half. Hinge on dorsal 
edge with about a dozen very tiny bar-like teeth. Usually found in colonies 
in crevices of stones. Two small clams, <tname>Lasaea cistula Keen</tname> and <tname>L. subviridis

Carpenter</tname> and <tname>B. adamsianus Dunker</tname> are closely related species, if not mere 
forms, found in the Panamic province.
