shelly cup is attached to the inside of the shell and is flattish, arises near the 
center of the shell and flares out to the edge. Its free side is thickened into a 
columella-like, rounded edge. Commonly dredged in shallow water, especially off southeast Florida. Formerly known as <tname>C. candeana Orbigny</tname>.

Ys to I inch in diameter, about H to % as high; the outline of the base 
of the shell is perfectly circular, and the apex is at the center of the shell. 
Interior glossy-white with the sinuate edge of the internal cup arising at the 
apex of the shell as a thickened, twisted columella and ending in fragile attachment near the edge of the shell. Young forms (<tname>C. contorta Cpr.</tname>) are 
relatively higher-spired. Exterior chalky-white with a thin, brownish periostracum. Dredged moderately commonly from lo to 75 fathoms.

I inch in diameter, similar to <tname>C. striatum</tname>, but the edges of the inner cup 
are entirely free. The edges of the main shell are crenulated, the external 
ribs are coarser, and the interior is sometimes pinkish. The outer surface may 
show coarse diagonal ribs if the specimen has lived attached to a scallop or 
other ribbed mollusk. Uncommonly dredged in shallow water and occasionally washed ashore.
