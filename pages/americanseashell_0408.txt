1% to 2 inches in length, extremely close to <tname>Protothaca sta?mnea</tname> and 
grata Sowerby (the latter's range is from the Gulf of California to Panama), 
but differing from both in being much more elongate and more compressed. 
Its lunule and small escutcheon are more distinct and quite smooth as compared to those of stavnnea. The hinges are extremely similar. <tname>P. grata</tname> differs 
in having tiny, distinct crenulations on the inside of the anterior dorsal 
margin. <tname>T. seviideciissata Reeve</tname> appears to be the same as this introduced 
species. Its colors are variable and commonly variegated. Alias <tname>T. bifurcata
