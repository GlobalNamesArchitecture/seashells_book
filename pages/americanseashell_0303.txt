Worldwide, pelagic. (43° N. to 42° S.). 

10 to 14 mm. in length. See generic description and figure. The shell 
varies somewhat in shape. <tname>C. oryza Benson</tname>, <tname>C. iirceolaris Morch</tname> and cmicellata Pfeffer are the same. Common. 

Suborder <tname>GYMNOSOMATA</tname> 

Pteropods characterized by the absence of shell, pallial cavity and 
mantle-skirt; by the presence of a well-developed head, bearing two pairs of 
tentacles, of which the two posterior bear rudimentary eyes. Jaws and radula 
present. Found pelagic in all seas, and sometimes in great abundance. Rarely 
exceed one inch in length. They are carnivorous. Ascend to the surface at 
night, and sink to a lower level in the daytime. They are not treated in this 
book. The group contains such genera as <tname>Pjieuviodennopsis Bronn 1862</tname>,
