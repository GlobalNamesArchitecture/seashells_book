Alaska to Lower California. Japan to south China. 

Length, including longest arm, ^ to 3 feet (possibly with a radial spread 
of nearly 28 feet in Alaskan waters). Skin in preserved specimens covered 
everywhere by numerous small, pimple-like tubercles with star-shaped bases, 
and by many heavy, much interrupted, longitudinal wrinkles. Above each 
eye there is a rather small, conical wart and with a very large, pinnacle-like 
protuberance behind it. Ligula index 4 to 7. The web between the second 
and third arms usually extends out to a quarter of the arm's length. Elsewhere the webs are shorter. The commonest littoral Octopus on the Pacific 
Coast found from shore to 100 fathoms. This is <tname>O. punctatns Gabb</tname>. 

<tname>O. californicus Berry</tname>, an off-shore species, has a large lingula with an 
index of 14 to 17. The skin in preserved material is covered with numerous, 
large stellate warts. The Californian Deep-water Octopus. 

<tname>Octopus bi?naculatus Verrill</tname> Two-spotted Octopus 

Los Angeles, California, to Lower California. 

Total length ^ to 2 feet. Characterized by a large, distinct, round, dark 
spot in front of each eye near the base of each third arm. Eggs small, 1.8 to 
4.0 mm. in length with long stalks, attached in festoons. Mantle-arm index 
usually 22, but ranging from 14 to 29. Ligula-index 2.0, not significant in 
separating this species from bimaculoides. Fairly common. Lives in the lower 
part of the intertidal zone down to several feet where there is rock bottom.

Aside from egg-size and egg-clusters and mantle-arm index, there is great 
difficulty in separating this species from <tname>O. bimaciiloides Pickford</tname> which 
lives nearby in shallower water where there is mud present. 

<tname>Octopus bimaciiloides Pickford</tname> Mud-flat Octopus 

Los i\ngeles, California, to Lower California. 

Almost identical with <tname>O. bimacidatus Verrill</tname>. Eggs large, 9.5 to 17.5 
mm. in length, with shorter stalks, attached in small clusters. Mantle-arm 
index 34, but ranging from 29 to 39. Fairly common in shallow water among 
rocks where mud is present. Adults are somewhat smaller than bimacidatus.

Guide to the 
Molluscan Literature 



The literature dealing with mollusks is very extensive and widely scattered 
in many journals and books. Since 1900, approximately 60,000 separate 
articles on mollusks have appeared. Most of these are listed according to 
author and subject matter in the Zoological Record (printed for the Zoological Society of London and in its 86th volume). This valuable journal may
