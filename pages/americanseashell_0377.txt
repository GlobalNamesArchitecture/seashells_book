Shell thin, orbicular and strongly inflated. There are 2 cardinal teeth in 
each valve. The left anterior and right posterior ones are split or bifid. Laterals obscure or absent. Taras Risso, commonly used in place of the name 
<tname>Diplodonta</tname>, is a doubtful name which has been recently abandoned. 

Subgenus <tname>Diplodonta s. str.</tname> 
<tname>Diplodonta punctata Say</tname> Common Atlantic Diplodon 

North Carolina to both sides of Florida and the West Indies. 

% to % inch in length, moderately strong, almost orbicular, well-inflated 
and pure-white in color. Smooth near the beaks, elsewhere very finely 
scratched with concentric lines and commonly with distantly spaced, coarse 
growth lines. Fairly common in shallow to deep water. 

<tname>Diplodonta orbella Gould</tname> Pacific Orb Diplodon 

Alaska to Panama. 

% to I inch in length, almost circular in outline, quite inflated and 
smoothish except for moderately coarse growth lines. Beaks small, pointing 
slightly forward. Ligament posterior to beaks is long, raised and conspicuous. 
2 rather large teeth in each valve below the beaks. Left anterior and right 
posterior teeth split. In many shallow-water localities, this clam builds a 
compact nest of periostracal material and detritus. In its more southerly 
range, specimens are usually more compressed, less orbicular in shape and 
more glossy externally (subspecies subquadrata Carpenter). Alias <tname>Taras orbella</tname>. 

Subgenus <tname>Phlyctiderma Dall 1899</tname> 
<tname>Diplodonta semiaspera Philippi</tname> Pimpled Diplodon 

North Carohna to Florida, Texas and the West Indies. 

Rarely over V2 inch in length, similar to <tname>D. punctata</tname>, but chalky-white 
externally and with numerous concentric rows of microscopic pimples. Moderately common in sand below low-water mark to 40 fathoms. Alias <tname>D. 
granulosa C. B. Adams</tname>.
