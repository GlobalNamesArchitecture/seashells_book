About I inch in length, extremely fragile, inflated and with a very short, 
inconspicuous ligament. Color translucent-white with a thin, greenish, glossy 
periostracum. This species was named inflatula Dall at a later date.

3 inches in length, moderately elongate, moderately inflated and rather 
thick-shelled. Beaks % toward the posterior end. Resembles calcarea whose 
pallial sinus in the left valve, however, is more elongate, not as high and 
generally reaches nearer the anterior muscle scar. <tname>M. brota</tname> is larger and 
more truncate posteriorly than that species. Common.

Arctic Ocean to Puget Sound, Washington. 

About I inch in length. Extremely similar to calcarea, but porcellaneous, 
with a glossy, yellowish periostracum and more oval in shape. This species 
was thought by Dall and others to be ''''carlottejisis Whiteaves."

Commonly 1% inches in length (rarely 3); oval-elongate, moderately 
inflated, very sHghtly twisted, if at all, at the posterior end. Pallial sinus in

<tname>Aiacoma incongnm von Martens</tname> (fig. 88b) (Alaska to Washington) is 
similar, but more oval, with a more pointed slope at the beaks, a straighter 
posterior dorsal edge. Its upper pallial sinus line, after nearly reaching the 
anterior muscle scar, turns downward and then runs anteriorly before connecting with the paUial sinus. Common in Alaska.
