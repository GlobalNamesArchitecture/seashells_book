% to I /4 inches in length. Characterized by the deep, narrow, smoothsided umbilicus which is bordered by a spiral, beaded thread, and by the 
swollen, rounded periphery of each whorl, which in the spire is located just 
above the suture. Color ranges from brownish cream to reddish and is often 
maculated with white splotches near the periphery. Typical jujubinum has 
a spire angle of about 50 degrees; the spiral threads on the whorls are weakly 
beaded, and the umbilicus is almost closed.

swollen at its periphery, and has 9 to 10 well-beaded spiral threads between 
each suture.

<tname>C. bairdi psyche Dall</tname> (North Carolina to Key West, 30 to 130 fathoms) 
is usually % inch in length, slightly wider, with a spire angle of about 75 to 
80 degrees, and the color is lighter and more pearly. Base with 3 or 4 spiral 
brown lines. It has a chink-like depression beside the umbilicus. Uncommon.
