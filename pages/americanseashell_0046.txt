Identification of Chitons 

It is essential for accurate identifications to refer to one or more ot the 
ten technical terms used in describing the various parts of the chiton. A few 
minutes' study of figure i8 will prepare the reader for the photographs, 
identification drawings and descriptions of the species. Jumping to conclusions from the photographs instead of ascertaining the family or genus first 
will lead to discourag-ino- results.
