compressed. Beaks tiny, quite near the rounded anterior end. Right valve 
smoothish and transkicent cream. Left valve more prominently divided into 
2 portions by a slight radial groove, anterior to which the shell is dull cream, 
and posterior to which the shell is more glossy but with microscopic concentric growth lines. Sometimes slightly iridescent. Interior pearly. Moderately common in sand below low water to 60 fathoms. 

<tname>Pandora arenasa Conrad</tname>, the Sand Pandora, (Carolinas to southeast 
Florida) is commonly dredged by amateurs. It is very much like trilineata, 
but never over /^ inch in length, completely lacking the rostrum and with 
a quite convex left valve which has an external radial rib below the hinge 
margin ridge. Common. <tname>P. carolinensis Bush</tname> is this species.
