shell is glossy-white with numerous, fine spiral lines of dark- to yellowbrown. Aperture white. An exceedingly common species found in nearly 
every region on rocks and wharf pilings.

2 to 3 inches in length, with 3 large, thin, foliaceous varices per whorl 
which are finely fimbriated on the anterior side. Numerous spiral cords are 
rather prominent and of various sizes. Siphonal canal closed, its anterior tip

Aperture white. Exterior white to Hght-brown. Common in the Puget 
Sound area and to the north on rocks near shore. Also down to 35 fathoms. 
Appears in some books as <tname>Purpura</tname> or <tname>Ceratostoina foliatum Martyn</tname>.

1/4 to 2 inches in length, similar to <tname>Pter. foHata</tname> (and somewhat resembling <tname>Ocenebra poulsom</tname>)^ but with much more poorly developed varices, 
and with one prominent, noduled rib between each varix. Spine on outer lip 
usually long and sharp. Exterior yellowish brown, sometimes spirally banded. 
Siphonal canal closed along its length. A common littoral species in the 
southern part of its range.

South of Cape Cod to south half of Florida. 

/4 to I inch in length; apex pointed; siphonal canal moderately long, 
almost closed, coming to a sharp point below. Last varix large, rounded and 
with small nodules. Inside of outer lip with about 6 small, bead-like teeth. 
Whorls with spiral cords and strong axial ribs. Th-^re are 4 to 6 axial ribs 
between the last 2 varices. <tname>E. etterae B. B. Baker</tname> is a large, ecologic form of 
this species. 

<tname>Eupleura sulcidentata Dall</tname> Sharp-ribbed Drill 

Figure 47c 

West coast of Florida. 

Similar to <tname>E. caudata</tname>, but with the spiral sculpture almost absent. There 
are only 2 or 3 axial ribs between the last 2 varices. The varices are thin and 
sharp, and the entire shell is slightly compressed laterally (has a more oval 
outline from an apical or top view than does caudata). The axial ribs are 
often sharp and may bear a small spine at the top. Color gray, chocolatebrown, tan or rarely pinkish, and sometimes with a narrow spiral brown 
band. Moderately common. <tname>E. stimpsoiii Dall</tname> from deep water in the Gulf 
of Mexico is figured on p. 209.
