strongly convex whorls, bearing about 8 strong to poorly developed, raised 
spiral cords (2 of which usually show in each whorl in the spire). Faint, 
quite small, spiral threads are also present. Exterior dull whitish brown. 
Aperture enamel-white with a tan tint. Fairly common in Alaska from shore 
to 50 fathoms. This is <tname>Chrysodo?mis Jirata Martyn</tname>.

Alaska to Oregon. 

1V2 inches in length, solid, outer lip sharp, strong and crenulated. Siphonal canal short, wide and slightly twisted. Spiral cords strong. Suture 
channeled. Shell chalk-white, but covered with a rather thick, yellow-brown 
to gray periostracum which is axially lamellate and bears minute, erect hairs. 
Aperture glossy-white. Not uncommonly dredged from 62 to 780 fathoms. 
<tname>N. calif ornica Dall</tname> and bicincta Dall appear to be this species.

British Columbia to San Diego, California. 

3 to 4 inches in length, moderately solid, with 8 whorls, colored white 
with a thin brown periostracum. Characterized by the wide, flat channel 
next to the suture. It is bounded by a raised, scaly or fimbriated spiral cord. 
Remainder of whorl with numerous sandpapery spiral threads. A choice collector's item, not uncommonly dredged from 30 to 200 fathoms.

Santa Barbara, California, to San Quentin Bay, Mexico. 

4 to 5 inches in length, characterized by its very heavy, white, fusiform 
shell, its fine, wavy suture, and by the sharp, crenulated outer lip. Whorls 
slightly concave between the suture and the shouldered periphery, which 
bears 10 strong, rounded knobs per whorl. Base with about 6 to 10 incised, 
spiral lines. Aperture glossy and white. Very commonly caught in traps 
from 10 to 35 fathoms. There are no other recent species in the genus. Often 
misspelled with two t's.

/4 inch in length, fairly strong, pure white in color and with cancellate 
sculpturing. Last whorl with 12 to 14 low axial ribs which are crossed by 
about a dozen spiral cords (between which there may be a much smaller 
thread). At their intersection there are small beads. Outer lip with a frilled,
