% to 2^2 inches in length; whorls distorted, aperture with grotesque 
arrangement of the teeth; siphonal canal twisted. Whorls with coarse reticulate pattern. Parietal shield glossy, reticulated with raised threads, colored 
white to brownish white. Differs from constricta mcgintyi in having a less 
distorted body whorl which is more evenly rounded and more evenly knobbed 
or reticulated. The parietal wall is generally reticulated instead of pustuled. 
Dredged from 5 to 65 fathoms. Frequently brought in by shrimp fisherman.

North Carolina to south half of Florida. 

I to 2 inches in length, very close to clatbrata, but the body whorl is 
very distorted, bulging and with cruder nodules. The upper and inner corner 
of the aperture usually has only one small, short, white tooth, while in clatbrata there are usually 2 fairly large, longer, obliquely set teeth. The lower 
parietal wall has a deep, smooth, wide groove separating the two axial rows 
of teeth. Commonly dredged from 25 to 125 fathoms. Formerly called <tname>D. 
-ftoridana Olsson and AlcGinty 1951</tname> (not floridana Gardner 1947). Typical 
constricta Broderip is from the Eastern Pacific.

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

Adults I to I % feet in length. The early whorls are purplish pink. In old 
specimens these are usually lost. Adults usually have a swollen, angular 
shoulder on the last whorl, a feature which distinguishes our Atlantic subspecies from the typical tritonis Linne of the Indo-Pacific area. <tname>C. atlantica 
Bowdich</tname> is a synonym of the Pacific subspecies, despite the name. Rare in 
Florida; moderately common in the West Indies below low water.
