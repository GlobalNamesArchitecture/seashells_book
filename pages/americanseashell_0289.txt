North Carolina to southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

2 to 3 mm. in length, spindle-shaped, rather oblong, fragile, except for 
minute spiral lines at each end. Upper end of aperture ends in a very sharp, 
rather prolonged spike. Umbilicus rarely, if ever, present. Commonly 
dredged down to 150 fathoms. <tname>R. 7ni?iutus Bush</tname> is probably the young. 
<tname>R. aspinosiis Dall</tname> from the same region has the process poorly developed, 
and may be a form of this species.

Arctic Seas to Florida and the West Indies. 

I to 1% inches in length, very lightweight, but moderately strong. 
Ovate-oblong. Apex with a slightly sunken area. Aperture constricted 
above, roundly open below. Columella simple, rounded. Shell smoothish, 
except for numerous, spiral rows of microscopic, elongate punctations. Color

fathoms. 

<tname>Scaphander 720 bills \^errill</tname> (Noble Canoe-bubble) from off New England is the same size or smaller, has a proportionately much larger aperture, 
its outer lip is wing-like above, and the microscopic punctations are round. 
It is uncommon. A figure of <tname>S. luatsoni Dall</tname> is on plate 26m.

at the upper portions. Spire of 5 whorls, elevated, pointed and with a tiny, 
pimple-like nucleus (usually eroded in northern specimens) . Suture narrowly 
and deeply channeled. Body whorl swollen at the lower half. With numerous microscopic, wavy, incised spiral lines. Color yellowish, sometimes with 
numerous golden-yellow, fine spiral lines. Columella is a single, raised spiral

more constricted than in the much smaller species, <tname>Retiisa ohtusa</tname>. Formerly 
placed in the genus <tname>Retusa</tname>. Uncommon from 26 to 34 fathoms.
