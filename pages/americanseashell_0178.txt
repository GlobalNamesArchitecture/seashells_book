shouldered a little distance below the suture. Umbilicus deep, round and 
narrow. Characterized by the brown-stained, rather small, button-like callus 
partially obscuring the top edge of the umbilicus. A very common species 
found in shallow water to 25 fathoms. They are more commonly found in 
the summer months. Do not confuse with <tname>P. draconis</tname>.

moderately thickened with a white glaze. Umbilicus almost closed to slischtlv
