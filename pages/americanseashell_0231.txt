<tname>Thais canaliculata Duclos</tname> Channeled Dogwinkle 

Figure 48b, c 

Aleutian chain to Monterey, California. 

I inch in length, moderately globose, its spire higher than that of emarginata, but lower than that of lamellosa. Columella arched, flattened below. 
Characterized by about 14 to 16 low, flat-topped, closely spaced, spiral cords 
on the body whorl. Suture slightly channeled. Color white or orangebrown, often spirally banded. Moderately common on rocks and mussel beds. 
Do not confuse with lima from Alaska. 

<tname>Thais emarginata Deshayes</tname> Emarginate Dogwinkle 

Figure 48a 

Bering Sea to Mexico. 

I inch in length, with a rather short spire and with globose whorls. 
Aperture large. Columella strongly arched, and flattened and slightly concave below. Sculpturing variable, but characteristically with coarse spiral 
cords, usually alternatingly small and large. Cords often scaled or coarsely 
noduled. Exterior yellow-gray to rusty-brown, often with darker, narrow 
spiral bands. Interior and columella light- to chestnut-brown. Exceedingly 
common in many places along the coast where there are rocks.
