American Seashells 



The highly developed swimming ability of the scallops accounts for 
the migratory powers of the great schools of these active bivalves. One 
would normally expect the direction of swimming taken by a scallop snapping its valves together to be "backward" in the direction of the hinges. 
Although that type of movement is on rare occasions used as an escape 
measure, the typical swimming movement is in the opposite direction with 
the free edge of the shell going in front, so that the animal appears to be 
taking a series of bites out of the water. This odd action is made possible 
by the vertical, curtain-like edges of the muscular mantle. When the valves 
are snapped shut by the powerful adductor muscle, water is driven out, not 
past the mantle curtains but through the regions around the hinge or ears of 
the shell. By manipulating these curtains, which can be extended or withdrawn locally, the scallop is able to vary the amount and position of exodus 
of water and hence can direct its course. If accidentally turned over onto 
the wrong valve, the scallop can execute a neat flip and regain its normal 
position. 

While the scallop always swims with its valves in a horizontal plane, 
the <tname>Lw/^</tname> File Clams most frequently progress edgewise, that is, with the 
breadth of the valves vertical or slightly oblique. The long, colorful tentacles of the <tname>Lifna</tname> keep the animal momentarily suspended in water while 
the valves are being opened in preparation for another "bite" forward. The 
<tname>Li7na</tname> is a poor swimmer and, because of its habit of building nests under 
rocks, apparently has no incentive to undertake migrations as is done by

the scallops. Scallops of the genus <tname>Chlamys</tname> are equally poor swimmers and, 
unlike adult <tname>Pecten</tname>, spin small byssal threads for attachment to the bottom. 

Burrowing in sand and mud is accomplished by the foot of the bivalve. 
The principle is the same in all digging clams. The foot is slowly protruded 
with the pointed tip wriggling down into the mud. During this extension 
the end of the foot is kept small, but when it reaches its greatest extension 
the end is suddenly swelled into a great bulb and the whole foot becomes very
