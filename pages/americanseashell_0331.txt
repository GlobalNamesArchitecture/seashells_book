The bivalves or clams are dwellers of fresh, marine or brackish waters. 
They lack a head and are without jaws or radular teeth; they are protected 
by a pair of shelly valves which are connected or hinged by a horny ligament 
and which are moved by the contraction of one to three muscles attached 
to the inner sides of the valves; feeding is usually done with the aid of their 
ciliated or hair-covered gills. Further details have been presented in the 
chapter on "The Life of the Clam." The class is also known as <tname>Lmnellibranchia</tname>, <tname>Bivalvia</tname> or <tname>Acephala</tname>. The class may be divided into the follov/ing 
orders and suborders:

Family <tname>SOLEMYACIDAE</tname> 

Genus <tname>Solemya Lamarck 1818</tname> 

The Awning Clams are very primitive in their characters and they have 
no near relatives. Their shells are fragile, with a weak, toothless hinge, 
gaping at both ends, and covered by a polished, horny, brown periostracum 
which extends well beyond the margins of the valves.
