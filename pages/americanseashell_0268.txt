color. Like <tname>Gibberulina ovuHforims</tname>, but the aperture is not so long and has 
microscopic, spiral teeth inside the thin, curled-in outer lip. Columella with 
4 oblique folds. Alias <tname>M. lavalleaiia Orb</tname>. Common in shallow water to 40 
fathoms. The subgenus <tname>Granula Jousseaume 1874</tname> is this subgenus. 

<tname>Persicula jeivetti Carpenter</tname> Jewett's Marginella 

Monterey, California, to Lower California. 

/4 inch (5,0 mm.) in length, snow-white, glossy, rather stout. Apex 
smoothed over and obscured. Outer lip smooth, slightly curled inward. Columella with 3 or 4 rather distinct, slanting, spiral folds with several smaller 
ones higher on the columella. Common from low tide to several fathoms. 

There are 3 similar, small and white species which are very difficult to 
separate; and according to some workers, size and proportionate dimensions 
are of significance: 

<tname>F. regzilaris Cpr.</tname> (Regular Marginella), Monterey to Lower California. 

Length 3.3 mm., ratio of diameter to length i to 1.5. Low tide to 

30 fathoms. Common. 
<tname>P. subtrigona Cpr.</tname> (Triangular Marginella), Monterey to Lower Cahfornia. Length 3.5 mm., ratio of diameter to length i to 1.25. Low 

tide to 50 fathoms. Uncommon. 
<tname>P. politula Dall</tname> (Polite Aiarginella), Santa Barbara to Lower California. 

Length 3.0 mm., ratio of diameter to length i to 2. Low tide to 20 

fathoms. Uncommon. 

Genus <tname>Hyalina Schumacher 18 17</tname> 
Subgenus <tname>Voharina Hinds 1844</tname> 

<tname>Hyaliva avena Valenciennes</tname> Orange-banded Marginella 

Plate I ip; figure 56i 

North Carolina to Key West and the West Indies. 

M to % inch in length, slender; spire pointed, but short. Outer lip curled 
in, white and smooth. Aperture narrow above, wide below. 3 to 4 slanting, 
columellar teeth. Color whitish, cream or yellowish with 4 to 6 spiral bands 
of subdued orange-tan. A moderately common, shallow-water species. The 
pink variety, especially common in Yucatan has been given the name beyerleana Bern. 

<tname>Hyalina veliei Pilsbry</tname> Velie's Marginella 

West coast of Florida. 



<tname>MARGINELLIDAE</tname> 2 59 

% inch in length, somewhat like our figure 566, but with a higher, more 
pointed spire. Shell quite thin for a Marginella; color yellowish to whitish 
and somewhat translucent. Outer lip thickened, pushed in at the middle and 
white in color. Columella with 4 very distinct folds. Common in shallow 
water inside dead Pinna shells on mangrove mud flats.
