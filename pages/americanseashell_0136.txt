and with lamellate growth lines. Moderately common in sand below lowwater line. Known for years as <tname>A. granulata Lamarck</tname> which, however, is a 
later name.

% inch in diameter, similar to <tname>A. nobilis</tname>, but glossy-smooth on top 
except for two microscopic spiral threads above the suture, with a smooth 
rounded base and with its deep umbilicus bordered by 2 beaded spiral rows, 
the innermost having about 30 bar-like beads (in contrast to 12 in nobilis). 
Operculum chitinous, brown and multispiral. Uncommon from 16 to 63

West Coast of Florida. 

Lives in closely packed colonies of long, worm-like shells about 2 to 4 
inches in length; each tube is about % inch in diameter. Shells rarely coiled, 
except at the beginning. Moderately fragile, gray to rusty-brown in color, 
and weakly sculptured spirally and longitudinally. Colonies of this species 
frequently form large reefs or banks.

Similar to nigricans, but greatly coiled, and with heavier, larger shells 
which are strongly rugose. Occurs in compact masses attached to rocks and 
other shells. Color dark brownish.<tname> P. erectus Dall</tname> is smoother, pure white 
in color, and with the last part of the tube sticking straight up from the
