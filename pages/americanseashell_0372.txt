Genus <tname>Cardita Bruguiere, 1792</tname> 

Shell small, thick, radially ribbed, quadrate, with a slight ventral gape 
and having a byssus. The animal has a marsupium to contain its eggs. Posterior right cardinal usually absent or almost so. This appears to be the 
accepted use of <tname>Cardita</tname> according to Winckworth, Chavan, Lamy and Dall. 

Subgenus <tname>Carditamera Conrad 1838</tname> 

<tname>Carditaviera</tname> has shells which are more elongate and have strong lateral

Southern half of Florida and Mexico. 

I to I /4 inches in length, about half as high, elongate, inflated, solid and 
heavy. Surface with about 20 strong, rounded, raised, beaded, radial ribs. 
In live material, the gray periostracum obscures the color of the shell. Exterior whitish to gray with small bars of chestnut color on the ribs arranged 
in concentric series. Interior white with a small light-brown patch above 
the two muscle scars. Beaks close together. Lunule small, very deeply indented under the beaks. Ligament moderately large, visible from the outside. Very common on the west coast of Florida where it is washed ashore. 
Used extensively in the jewelry business. 

<tname>Cardita gracilis Shuttleworth</tname> is doubtfully recorded from Florida but is 
known from Mexico to Puerto Rico. It is quite elongate, narrow at the 
anterior end, with larger, smoothish ribs, and the posterior lateral tooth is 
stained dark-brown. Uncommon. 

The Pacific Coast species is <tname>Cardita carpenteri Lamy</tname> (pi. 29r) which is 
V'z inch long and ranges from British Columbia to Lower California in shallow to deep water. Its color is brownish gray with a purplish interior.
