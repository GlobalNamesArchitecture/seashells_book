and slightly flaring. Interior brownish white enamel. Columella slightly 
arched, white within, brown on the parietal wall. Exterior surface brownish

Alaska. 

4 to 5 inches in length, moderately heavy, with 5 to 6 whorls. Characterized by the very strong, rounded spiral cords (3 to 4 between sutures) 
which on the base of the shell tend to be flat-topped. Periostracum grayish 
brown, thin and semi-glossy. A very handsome, but not commonly acquired 
species which occurs from 80 to 100 fathoms.

Figure 5ig 

Alaska. 

5 to 6 inches in length, not very heavy. Characterized by about 9 strong, 
arched, somewhat rounded axial ribs extending from suture to suture, and, 
on the body whorl, extending % the way down the whorl. Spiral sculpture 
of microscopic scratches, except on the base where there are a dozen or so 
weak threads. Periostracum light-brown, thin, and usually flakes off in dried 
specimens. Shell chalky and whitish gray in color. Not uncommon in several fathoms of water; rarely in very shallow water.
