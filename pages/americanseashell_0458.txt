Figure 95f 

South half of Florida and the AVest Indies. 

Pallets !4 to I inch in length. Cones deeply cupped, with beautiful, 
comb-like serrations on the edges. It has been found on the Pacific side of 
the Panama Canal, and those specimens were named <tname>Bankia canalis Bartsch</tname>. 



Genus <tname>Teredo Linne 1758</tname> 

Similar to <tname>Bcmkia</tname>, but the pallet is made up of a single, paddle-shaped 
piece. 

<tname>Teredo navalis Linne</tname> Common Shipworm 

Both coasts of the United States. Europe and Africa. 

Shell like that in <tname>Bankia</tname> and subject to many minute variations. Each 
of the 2 calcareous pallets is spathate and compressed, but typically symmetrical. The leathery blade is urn-shaped, widening regularly from a stalk 
of medium length, then tapering somewhat toward the tip, which is decidedly 
excavated. The base of the blade is calcareous, but approximately the distal 
third is normally covered by a yellowish or brownish chitinous epidermis. 
A very common and destructive species found boring in wood.
