Gulf of St. Lawrence to off North Carolina. 

2 to 2% inches in length, very similar to stimpsoni, but the aperture is 
about % the entire length of the shell, the suture more abruptly impressed, 
the whorls slightly more convex and the siphonal canal usually, but not 
always, more twisted. Very commonly dredged from 18 to 640 fathoms.

Plate 23m 

Gulf of St. Lawrence to off North Carolina. 

Less than i inch in length, with 6 to 7 fairly convex whorls, fairly fragile, chalk-white, with spiral incised lines, and covered with a light olive-gray, 
thin, velvety periostracum. Aperture slightly more than % the length of the 
entire shell. Commonly dredged from i to 640 fathoms. 

<tname>Coins caelata Verrill and Smith</tname> (Massachusetts to North Carolina, deep 
water) is about the same size, but is characterized by about 12 strong axial 
ribs per whorl in addition to numerous fine spiral threads. It is chalky-white 
to gray.
