Southern half of Florida, and the West Indies. 

A small species with a length, including the longest arm, of from 4 to 
6, rarely 7 inches. The arms are short, with a mantle-arm index of about 40 
to 50. Ligula-index about 6 to 7. Gill plates 5 or 6 usually. Skin smoothish, 
except for little pimples at scattered intervals. In this species, the longest arm 
is only 2 or 3 times the mantle-length, while in <tname>O. briareus</tname> the longest arm 
is 5 or 6 times as long as the mantle. Eggs large, amber-colored, and about 
7 to 10 mm. in length. Occasionally cast ashore in fair numbers on the west 
coast of Florida. <tname>O. 77tercatoris Adam 1937</tname> is the same. Formerly placed in 
the genus <tname>Paroctopus</tname> which is now considered of no value.
