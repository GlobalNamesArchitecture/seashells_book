however, is more of the consecutive type, in which the gonads at first produce sperm and later in the season only eggs. 

Sex reversal is especially characteristic of the Slipper Shell family. The 
best known examples belong to the Cup-and-saucer Shells, <tname>Calyptraea</tname> and 
<tname>Crucibulum</tname>, and the true Slipper Shells, <tname>Crepidula</tname>. Individuals function as

the male sex when young and as females when fully grown. The change-over 
may be gradual with the individual being ambisexual for a short period, or 
the male phase may suddenly disappear with the loss of its associated organs, 
and the female organs may then quickly develop. The males are much 
smaller than the females. In most species, each young male tends to creep 
about until it finds an individual of the same species in the female phase, 
whereupon it attaches itself to the dorsal side of the female's shell in a position adjacent to the female copulatory organs (fig. yi). In other species the
