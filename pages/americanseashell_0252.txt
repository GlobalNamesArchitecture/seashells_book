to <tname>N. calif ornianus</tname>, but with much finer sculpture (usually finely cancellate 
or minutely beaded), and yellowish white in color with 2 or 3 narrow, spiral 
bands of orange-brown, one of which borders the suture. The sculpture is 
variable with spiral threads often predominant. Very abundant along most 
of the coast. Intertidal flats to 50 fathoms.

Squaw Creek, Oregon, to Lower California. 

I inch in length, without a thick parietal shield and the outer lip not 
thickened. Shell with numerous, rather coarse beads arranged in 20 to 30 
axial, slanting ribs. 11 to 12 spiral threads on the last whorl; 5 to 7 on the 
whorls above. Color white with an ashy or yellow-gray periostracum. 
Moderately common just offshore to 35 fathoms. Compare with perpinguis.

Alaska to Lower California. 

% to % inch in length, with a moderately high spire. Outer lip not 
thickened. Sculpture consists of numerous, small beads which are formed by 
the crossing of about a dozen small axial ribs and smaller spiral threads. Color 
yellowish gray. Common in shallow water in the north. 

The subspecies or form cooperi Forbes has weaker spiral threads and 
about 7 to 9 strong, whitish, smoother axial ribs which persist to the last of 
the body whorl. Color grayish yellow to whitish, often with fine, spiral, 
brown or mauve lines. Very common in the south.
