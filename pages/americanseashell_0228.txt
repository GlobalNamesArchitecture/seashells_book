I to I /4 inches in length, rather low-spired, solid, smoothish, except for 
numerous, poorly developed, spiral threads. Spine on lower, outer lip is 
strong, behind which on the base of the outside of the body whorl is a weak, 
spiral groove. Whorls slightly shouldered. Color bluish gray with numerous 
rows of small, red-brown dots. Aperture within is bluish white. A roundshouldered, smaller form (punctulata Sby. or lapilloides Conrad) is found

from Monterey to Lower California. A common southern species found 
above high-tide mark on rocks; also on mussel beds. 

<tname>Acanthina paucilirata Steams</tname> Checkered Thorn Drupe 

San Pedro, California, to Lower Cahfomia. 

% to /4 inch in length, characterized by about 6 spiral rows of small 
squares of black-brown on a cream-white background. Early whorls cancellate, later whorls smoothish except for 4 or 5 very small, smooth, raised, spiral 
threads. Top of whorl slightly concave. Spine at base of outer lip small and 
needle-like. Aperture dentate, brownish with black squares on the outer lip. 
Siphonal canal short. Common above high-tide mark in southern California.

Nova Scotia to southern Florida. Introduced to San Francisco and to 
England. 

% to I inch in length; without varices; outer lip slightly thickened on 
the inside and sometimes with 2 to 6 small, whitish teeth. Siphonal canal 
moderately short and straight. With about 9 to 12 rounded, axial ribs per 
whorl and with numerous, strong, spiral cords. Color grayish or yellowish 
white, often with irregular, brown, spiral bands. Aperture tan to dark-brown. 
This common species is very destructive to oysters. It occurs from intertidal 
areas down to about 25 feet or more. Females grow faster and hence are 
larger than the males. They may reach an age of 7 years. The drills move 
inshore to spawn. Each female spawns once a year (May to September in 
Virginia; June to September in Canada and England). The female deposits 
25 to 28 leathery, vase-shaped capsules, each containing 8 to 12 eggs. <tname>U. follyensis B. Baker</tname> is an ecologic form. 

<tname>Urosalpinx perrugata Conrad</tname> Gulf Oyster Drill 

Figure 47 d 
West coast of Florida (to Louisiana?). 

Similar to cinerea, but with 6 to 9 axial ribs which are quite large at the 
periphery of the whorl. The spiral cords are fewer and stronger. Aperture 
rosy-brown or yellow-brown. Outer lip more thickened on the inside and 
usually with 6 small, whitish teeth. This may be a subspecies of cinerea. 
Common on mudflats. Always compare with <tname>Muricopsis ostreanmt Conrad</tname> 
which resembles this species very closely.
