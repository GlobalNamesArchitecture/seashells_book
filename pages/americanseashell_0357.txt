North Carolina and south half of Florida. 

Similar in size and shape to rigida, but covered with many more, much 
smaller, sharp spines. It is usually thinner-shelled and lighter in color. Commonly washed ashore with rigida.

and a socket.

Plate 356 

North CaroHna to Florida, the Gulf States and West Indies, 

About I inch in length, somewhat cat's-paw-shaped. Shell strong, 
heavy, with 5 to 7 high ribs which give the valves a wavy, interlocking 
margin. Hinge in upper valve with 2 strong, equally sized teeth; lower 
attached valve with 2 sockets in the hinge with 2 smaller teeth set rather 
close together. Color dirty-white to gray with red-brown or purplish lines 
on the ribs. A common intertidal to offshore species. 

Family <tname>PECTINIDAE</tname> 

Because of the great number of fossil and living species of scallops and 
the almost limitless modifications exhibited by them, there have been no 
less than 50 genera and subgenera proposed in this family by various authors. 
Doubtlessly, many more will be invented. Most, if not all, of these genera 
are closely integrated by connecting species. Workers have a choice of 
using the single genus, <tname>Pecteji</tname>, or employing a genus for nearly every species. 
We are arbitrarily employing only six genera — <tname>Pecte</tname>??, <tname>Aequipecten</tname>, <tname>Chla772ys</tname>, <tname>Placopecten</tname>, <tname>Lyropecteii</tname> and <tname>Himiites</tname> — and we cannot justify these 
on biological grounds. It may be noted that we have moved the glassy, thinshelled <tname>Propeamiisshim</tname> from the <tname>Pectinidae</tname> into a family of its own on 
anatomical grounds. This new family refers to what was once called "<tname>Amussiidae</tname>." True <tname>Aumsiwn</tname>, however, is merely a subgenus of <tname>Pecteii</tname> connected 
to it by a series of species in the <tname>Euvola</tname> group.
