Figure 59b 

Arctic Seas to Connecticut. Europe. 

3 to 5 mm. in length, globose, thin, fragile, and transparent-tan in color. 
Last whorl globose below, constricted somewhat above. Apex large, globose, 
obliquely and mammillarly projecting. Suture deep. Columella long, straight, 
not thickened, the edge partly closing the narrow umbilicus. Moderately 
common from 6 to 16 fathoms. <tname>Diaphana debilis Gould</tname>, <tname>D. hiemalis Couthouy</tname> and <tname>D. globosa Loven</tname> are considered synonyms of this species by 
Lemche (1948) and other modern workers.

The names <tname>Vesica Swainson 1840</tname> and <tname>Bullaria Rafinesque 18 15</tname> have been 
ill-advisably used for this genus. Fortunately, the name <tname>Bulla</tname> has been 
conserved for this group of bubble-shells by the International Commission 
for Zoological Nomenclature.

West coast of Florida to Texas and the West Indies. 

% to I inch in length, similar to occidentalis, but larger, heavier, and 
with the spiral grooves well-marked toward the base of the shell and within 
the apical perforation. The whorls are compressed at the apical end. Columella usually with a brown-stained callus. Locally common. <tname>B. amygdala 
Brug.</tname> is probably a smooth form of this species. 

<tname>Bulla occidentalis A. Adams</tname> Common West Indian Bubble 

Plate 26p 

North Carolina to southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

V2 to I inch in length, smooth, varying from fragile to quite strong, 
and from cylindrical (young) to fairly swollen. Apex deeply and narrowly 
perforate. Color very variable, but usually whitish with mottlings, zebra 
stripes and obscure bands of brown. Surface with numerous, microscopic 
striations. This is a very common bubble-shell which is found most easily 
at night and at low tide on grassy, mud flats. The author is often misnamed 
as "C. B. Adams."
