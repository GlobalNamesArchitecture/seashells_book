Genus <tname>Xenophora Fischer von W. 1807</tname> 

This group of gastropods is noted for its peculiar habit of cementing 
to its own shell fragments of other shells, stones, bits of coral and coal. The 
animals resemble those of the Strombus conchs, but the operculum is much 
wider and not sickle-shaped. B. R. Bales once humorously observed:

"It is generally admitted that the camouflage of <tname>Xe?iophora</tname> is for protection 
rather than ornamentation, for it would be inconceivable that a female 
<tname>Xenophora</tname> would call over the back fence to her girl friend with, 'Come 
and see the perfect dream of a shell I picked up today and tell me if I have 
it on straight.' " 

There are 3 species in the Atlantic, one a shallow water species, the other two 
(longleyi Bartsch, pi. 23d, and caribaea Petit, pi. 2 3e) deep water inhabitants.

North Carolina to Key West and the West Indies. 

2 inches in diameter, not including foreign attachments. No umbilicus. 
From above, the shell with its attached rubble and shells looks like a small 
heap of marine trash. It will attach any kind of shell to itself, but in some 
areas has access to only one kind, say <tname>Chione cancellata</tname>. Animal bright-red. 
Seasonally not uncommon. Johnsonia is in error in calling this trochiformis 
Bom 1778 (not 1780), which is the Peruvian shell known formerly as 
<tname>Trochita radians Lam</tname>.
