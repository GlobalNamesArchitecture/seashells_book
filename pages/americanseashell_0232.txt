round-topped spiral cords, often smooth, sometimes minutely fimbriated. 
Cords often alternate in size. Color whitish or orange-brown, rarely banded. 
Common intertidally. Compare with canaliculata.

Tritonalia Fleming 1828 may also be used as a name for this genus, although Ocenebra would seem to be the wiser choice and will probably be
