knowledge of Latin or Greek in order to label a seashell. Nor is it supposed 
that one should attempt to remember the names, although it adds to the 
enjoyment of the study to absorb those of a few commoner species. In fact, 
it is not difficult to remember such scientific names as <tname>Venus</tname>, <tname>Mitra</tname>, <tname>Oliva</tname> 
and <tname>Conus</tname>. It may be of interest to beginners to know that few professional 
malacologists can remember more than a hundredth part of the total number 
of names. They, too, consult books to refresh their memories. 

Popular va?nes. Popular or vernacular names in seashells are in great 
need of standardization and, while their use sometimes has its drawbacks, 
there is no reason they cannot become as acceptable to the amateur as have 
the popular names of birds, fishes and wild flowers. It is true that one species 
may be known by one name in New England and another in Florida, but 
these are generally names which are in use by local fishermen and not necessarily accepted by amateur shell collectors. In the face of so much name 
changing in the scientific literature because of legalistic technicalities, the 
existence of a few provincial popular names seems little enough excuse for 
not attempting to standardize the common names of seashells. Throughout 
this book we have presented both scientific and popular names. The latter 
have been derived from several sources and listed only after careful consideration of the evidence. Private collectors, shell dealers, professionals and, 
in some cases, many popular books, both recent and old, have contributed to 
the final choice. In a few instances, alternate popular names which are wellentrenched along wide regions of our coast have been listed. Popularization 
of patronymic names, such as Clark's cone for <tname>Conus clarki</tname>, has been simple. 
Direct translations of the Latin have in many but not all cases been advisable. 
Many obvious direct translations have been avoided in order to avoid confusion with names already used for shells in other regions of the world. It is 
interesting to note that many popular names in use today were recorded by 
early eighteenth century writers, and that a few popular generic names are 
to be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny. We have not, of course, 
employed the rule of using the name first employed as is done in scientific 
nomenclature (rule of priority). It is hoped that this first listing of iioo 
popular names of American seashells will bring fuller enjoyment to the many 
amateurs who do not desire to "wrestle" with scientific names. 

Scientific names. A mollusk is given two parts to its scientific name â€” 
the genus, which is akin to a surname, such as Smith or Jones, and the species 



86 American Sea shells 

which is akin to a first name such as William or Julia. The generic name 
is always capitalized, e.g., <tname>Comis</tname>, <tname>Strombiis</tname> or <tname>Area</tname>, but the specific name 
which comes after the genus name is not, e.g., princeps, pilsh'yi or florideijsis. 
It is also customary to add the name of the person who described and 
christened the species; thus the Queen Conch of southern Florida and the 
West Indies is known as <tname>Strovibiis gigas Linne</tname>. If subspecies or geographical 
races are recognized, the name may appear, for example, as <tname>Melojtgena corona 
perspectiva Pilsbry</tname> or <tname>M. corona corona Gmelin</tname>, the latter being the typical 
race. W'e have employed subgenera throughout the book as center headings. 
They may also be written into the name in parentheses: <tname>Janthina (Violetta) 
gJobosa Swainson</tname>. It is wrong to put a generic synonym in the middle of 
the name, as <tname>Busy con {Fiilgiir) carica Gmelin</tname>. 

Some authorities may put the author's name in parentheses, for example, 
<tname>Modulus modulus (Linne)</tname>. This means that the species was first described 
under another genus, in this case, not <tname>Modulus</tname> but <tname>Trochus</tname>. Unfortunately, 
as our science becomes more advanced, parentheses must be used in the majority of the species, and their usefulness becomes offset by the tax on one's 
memory as to whether or not they are to be employed in the various species. 
Modern workers are attempting to abandon this useless frill of nomenclature, and in this book they are not used. Dates following the author's names 
refer to the date of publication and serve the useful purpose of tracking 
down the original reference. It should be noted that the "double i" ending
