grooves; embryonic shell small, smooth, bulbous and separated from the main 
shell by a constriction. This is the only species in the genus. 

Genus <tname>Clio Linne 1767</tname> 

Shell of a somewhat angular form, colorless, compressed dorso-ventrally, 
and with lateral keels. A cross-section of the anterior or open portion is thus 
always angular at the sides. There is generally a crest or ridge extending 
longitudinally along the back. Embryonic shell varies in form, but is always 
definitely separated from the rest of the shell. <tname>Cleodora Peron and Lesueur 
1 8 1 o</tname> is the same genus.

Genus <tname>Cavolina Abildgaard 1791 </tname>

Shell squat, bulbous, horny-brown in color, characterized by a much 
constricted aperture, which is, however, very broad transversely. Sides of 
shell often prolonged into spine-like projections. <tname>Cavolinia</tname> is an alternate, 
incorrect spelling, and <tname>Hyalaea Lamarck</tname> is a synonym of this genus.
