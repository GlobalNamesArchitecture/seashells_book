Arctic Seas to Massachusetts. Europe. 

Yz inch in length, of a transparent watery white, smooth. Rhinophores 
with 8 to 10 leaves. 3 branchial plumes, tripinnate. Labial armature of rows 
of imbricated hooks. Radula narrow, center naked, 25 to 27 rows of teeth; 
inner pleural large, denticulate on the inner margin. Outer pleural tooth 
small, smooth. <tname>A. sulpJmrea Stimpson</tname> is probably this species. On the northwest coast of Florida there is a <tname>Polycera {hummi Abbott)</tname> which superficially 
resembles this species in external features, but its radula indicates its true 
relationships.
