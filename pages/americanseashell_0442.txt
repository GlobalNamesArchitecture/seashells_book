end smaller than the elliptical posterior end. Shell chalky, dirty-white and 
with a coarse, varnish-like, yellowish brown periostracum. Worn shells have 
coarse, concentric, wide growth lines. The pallial sinus is larger in this species than in solidissima. Moderately common from low-tide line to 60 fathoms. The form alaskana Dall is probably a synonym. The fossil, <tname>5. voyi 
Gabb 1868</tname> from the Miocene or Pliocene is possibly only a subspecies.
