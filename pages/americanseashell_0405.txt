Rarely it has a purplish stain on the escutcheon and brown mottlings on the 
side. There have been a number of forms described. In the vicinity of St. 
Petersburg, Florida, there is a malformed race in which there is a sharp, 
elevated ridge passing from the umbo obliquely backward toward the pallial 
sinus on the inside of each valve. The Southern Quahog is common but 
has not been exploited commercially to any great extent.

coarse radial ribs. Escutcheon long, smooth and V-shaped, commonly with 
6 to 7 brown, zebra-stripes. Lunule heart-shaped, with minute vertical 
threads. Color externally is white to gray; internally glossy-white with a 
suffusion of purplish blue. A very common, shallow-water species in Florida. 
Beachworn specimens have a cancellate sculpturing. The subspecies mazycki 
Dall, off the Carolinas, Georgia and northeast Florida has a beautiful rosy

1 to I ^ inches both ways, thick, glossy-white to cream; interior white, 
commonly with a violet, radial band or splotch at the posterior third. Exterior with crowded, smooth, low, rounded, concentric ribs. The lower 
edge of these ribs bears many small bars which are Imed up one below the 
other to give the shell the impression that it has axial ribs. The concentric 
ribs become sharp and higher at the shell's extreme ends. Lunule with 
raised lamellations; escutcheon with very fine, transverse lines. Uncommon. 
Incorrectly spelled interpurpurea.
