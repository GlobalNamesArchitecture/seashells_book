Melongena corona perspinosa Pilsbry and Vanatta appears to be a 
good subspecies. (Tampa south to Lossmans Key, Florida). Up to 4% 
inches in length, heavier and wider than corona, with a wider aperture, and 
with shoulder spines standing out at right angles, and with 2 or 3 rows of 
smaller spines below the larger ones. A descendant possibly of the Pliocene 
subspecies subcoronata Heilprin. Soft parts and radula described and figured 
in Frank Lyman's excellent Shell Notes, vol. 2, no. 2-3, 1948 (published 
privately by Lyman, Lantana, Florida).
