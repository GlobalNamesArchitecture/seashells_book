arks can be placed under the single genus <tname>Area</tname>. The geological history and 
morphological studies force us to recognize three subfamilies. Many of the 
subgenera listed here are considered by some authorities as full genera. 1 
have refrained from defining their limits. 

Subfamily <tname>ARCINAE</tname> 
Genus<tname> Area Linne 1758</tname> 

Characterized by the long, narrow hinge line with numerous small teeth, 
by the large byssal notch on the ventral side, and the wide ligamental area 
between the beaks.

2 to 3 inches in length, about twice as long as deep. Color tan with 
flecks and zebra-stripe markings of reddish brown. Periostracum brown, 
matted. Ribs of irregular sizes. No concentric riblets. Do not confuse with 
<tname>A. umbonata</tname>. A common species which attaches itself to rocks with its 
byssus. Used extensively in the shellcraft industry. Formerly <tname>A. oceidentalis Philippi</tname>.

i^ to 2% inches in length. Similar to <tname>A. zebra</tname>, but differing in having

much larger, and in lacking the zebra stripes. Periostracum sometimes quite 
heavy and foliated. Commonly attached to underside of rocks in shallow 
water.

ment moderately developed. This species was also named Candida Gmelin,
