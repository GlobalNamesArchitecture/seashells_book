% to % inch in length, squarish, with the beaks near one corner. Radial 
ribs are fine, numerous, slightly beaded and often crossed by much finer, concentric threads. Color olive-brown. A very common offshore, cold-water

Less than % inch in size, oval, with numerous fine, decussated radial 
ribs. Color tan to yellowish gray. Dredged from 3 to 150 fathoms. A food 
of many marine fishes. Compare with glandula. 

Crenella divaricata Orbigny (North Carolina to southeast Florida and 
the West Indies) is even smaller than decussata, is pure white, and very inflated.

Genus Modiolus Lamarck 1799 

This group of mussels have shells of various forms in which the hinge is 
without teeth. The anterior end of the shell extends in front of the beaks, 
while in Mytilus 3 to 5 tiny teeth are present on the hinge and the beaks are 
at the very anterior end of the shell. Volsella Scopoli has been rejected.

Arctic Seas to northeast Florida. Arctic Seas to San Pedro, California. 

2 to 6 inches in length, heavy, with a coarse, rather thick, black-brown 
periostracum which in dried specimens flakes off to reveal a mauve-white,
