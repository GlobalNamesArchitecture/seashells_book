Genus <tname>Modiolus Lamarck 1799</tname> 

This group of mussels have shells of various forms in which the hinge is 
without teeth. The anterior end of the shell extends in front of the beaks, 
while in Mytilus 3 to 5 tiny teeth are present on the hinge and the beaks are 
at the very anterior end of the shell. <tname>Volsella Scopoli</tname> has been rejected.
