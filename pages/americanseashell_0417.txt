Santa Monica, California, to Mazatlan, Mexico. 

I to I % inches in length. Oblong-elongate, variable in shape and outline due to crowding in the rock burrow. Shell fairly thick, white, except 
for purplish blotches commonly behind the hinge and at the posterior end. 
Radial threads are coarser at the anterior end. Growth lines are irregular 
and coarse. Pallial sinus broadly rounded at its anterior end. Early or nepionic shell is shaped somewhat like a <tname>Donax</tname>, smooth, translucent purplish 
brown and rarely found attached at this early stage to rocks and kelp stalks. 
<tname>R. californiensis Pilsbry and Lowe</tname> is identical. 

<tname>Rupellaria dejiticulata Sowerby</tname> known only from Peru has a similar 
nepionic shell (contrary to other reports), has a narrower, triangular pallial
