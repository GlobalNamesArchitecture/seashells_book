and possibly present in the Lower Florida Keys. This species is a sanddweller. 

Order <tname>PTEROPODA</tname> 
(Sea Butterflies or Pteropods) 

These small, pelagic gastropods are very abundant in the open seas in 
nearly every part of the world. They are occasionally washed ashore, but 
more commonly their shells are found in dredge hauls. The identification of 
pteropods is important to many types of oceanographic studies. There are 
two suborders, <tname>Thecosomata</tname> or those having shells, and the <tname>Gymnosomata</tname> 
or those without shells. We have omitted the latter group, and refer interested workers to our bibliography. Every known American species (eastern 
Pacific and western Atlantic) of the shelled <tname>Thecosomata</tname> has been included 
and figured.

Arctic Seas to the Gulf of Maine. Arctic Seas to northern California. 

Up to 8 mm. in length, spire short, shell wider than long. Surface with 
relatively large, axial threads. Adults (over 3 mm.) without an operculum. 
Abundant enough in the Arctic Seas to serve as an important source of food 
for certain whales. <tname>S. pacifica Dall</tname> is the same. 

<tname>Spiratella retroversa Fleming</tname> Retrovert Pteropod

Arctic Seas to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. 

Up to 5 or 6 mm. in length, spire slightly elevated, umbilicus distinct, 
shell higher than wide. Entire surface covered with fine, spiral hues. 10 
whorls. <tname>Limacina balea Moller</tname> and <tname>Spirialis goiildi Stimpson</tname> are this species.
