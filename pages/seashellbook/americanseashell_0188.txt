Plate 9! 

North Carolina to the Gulf of Mexico. The Bahamas. 

3 to 4 inches in length, thin, rather fragile, and with spiral threads which 
are sometimes made reticulate by axial threads. Uncommon, except on the 
west coast of Florida where it is washed ashore in great numbers. No operculum present. Formerly known as Pyrula and Ficus papyratia Say, but the 
latter name is preceded by two earlier names, communis Roding 1798 and 
reticulata Lamarck 1816 (as well as 1822). 

Carol's Fig Shell (named after Mrs. Richard W. Foster), Ficus carolae 
Clench, is very rare, and is irregularly spotted with reddish brown on the 
inside of the shell. It was first discovered by Mr. Leo L. Burry of Sarasota off 
Key Largo, Florida, in 100 fathoms.
