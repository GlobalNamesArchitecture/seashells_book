arks can be placed under the single genus Area. The geological history and 
morphological studies force us to recognize three subfamilies. Many of the 
subgenera listed here are considered by some authorities as full genera. 1 
have refrained from defining their limits. 

Subfamily ARCINAE 
Genus Area Linne 1758 

Characterized by the long, narrow hinge line with numerous small teeth, 
by the large byssal notch on the ventral side, and the wide ligamental area 
between the beaks.

matted. Ribs of irregular sizes. No concentric riblets. Do not confuse with 
A. umbonata. A common species which attaches itself to rocks with its 
byssus. Used extensively in the shellcraft industry. Formerly A. oceidentalis Philippi.
