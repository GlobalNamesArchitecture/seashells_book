2 to 4 inches in length, oblong-oval, obese. Resembling Mercejiaria 
campechiensis, but characterized by numerous, fine, radial riblets which cause 
the sharp, concentric ribs to be serrated or beaded. Each side of the lunule 
is bounded by a long, deep, narrow furrow. Posterior muscle scar usually 
stained brown. Moderately common in shallow water in sand.

pallial sinus, by the very thick margin of the shell, and in the left valve by 
the presence of a button-like anterior lateral "tooth." Exterior whitish. 
Dredged occasionally from 40 to 70 fathoms. Considered a collector's item.
