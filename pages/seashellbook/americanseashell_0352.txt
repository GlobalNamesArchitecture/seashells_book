Arctic Ocean to Puget Sound, and North Atlantic. 

I to I % inches in length. Distinguished from discors by its larger size, 
and in having no pronounced radial riblet or depression separating the posterior third from the middle area. The periostracum is more often black in 
this species. The posterior area very often has numerous microscopic concentric scratches which, to the naked eye, give this area a dull finish. Like 
discors, this species is much fatter than niger.
