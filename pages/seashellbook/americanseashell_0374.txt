Subgenus Fleurovieris Conrad 1867 
Venericardia tridentata Say Three-toothed Cardita 

North Carolina to all of Florida. 

V4, inch in length and height, trigonal in shape, inflated, with 15 to 18 
heavily beaded strong radial ribs. Beaks close together, pointing slightly 
forward. Lunule oval, sharply impressed, smoothish. Escutcheon small, narrow. External color grayish brown, sometimes with red-brown mottlings. 
Hinge-teeth often purplish blue. Interior of valve stained with light-brown 
on white background. A common, moderately shallow-water species, usually 
confused with Cardita do77nngiiensis which, however, lacks the strong tridentate hinge, is ovate in shape, whose ribs are weakly beaded and whose 
beaks point toward each other.

^ inch in size, similar to V. borealis but much smaller, without a periostracum, pinkish or mottled brown, and more obhque. The ribs are wider, 
and close to each other. The subspecies flabella Conrad from Tampa Bay, 
Florida, has fewer ribs which are squarish and separated by furrows almost 
equal in size to the ribs themselves. V. perplana is common, flabella only 
locally found at certain seasons in few numbers.
