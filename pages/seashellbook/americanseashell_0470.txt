482 American Seashells 

Total length, including tentacular arms, i to 2 feet. Easily recognized 
by the accompanying illustration which shows the rather long, triangular fins. 
The proportion of fin-length to mantle-length varies from i to 1.8 and down 
to a ratio of i to 1.5. Adult males have the left ventral arm conspicuously 
hectocotylized (see fig. 99a). A very abundant species caught commercially
