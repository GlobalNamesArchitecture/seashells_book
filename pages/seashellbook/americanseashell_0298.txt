I mm, in length, very close in characters, except shape, to 5. retroversa, 
and thought by some workers to be a warm-water subspecies of that species.

Spiratella lesueuri Orbigny Lesueur's Pteropod 

Figure 64b 

Cape Cod, Massachusetts, south to Brazil. Indo-Pacific. (N. Lat. 42° 
to S. Lat. 40°). 

1.5 mm. in length, spire elevated somewhat; umbilicus distinct. Shell as 
long as wide. Spiral lines only around the umbilicus. 

Spiratella bulmwides Orbigny Bulimoid Pteropod 

Figure 6^d 

New York to southern Brazil. (N. Lat. 39° to S. Lat. 40°). 

2 mm. in length, spire high, shell twice as long as wide. Umbilicus very 
indistinct. Lip fragile and often broken. 6 to 7 whorls. 

Spiratella inflata Orbigny Planorbid Pteropod 

Figure 64h 

Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to Argentina. (N. Lat. 42° to S. Lat. 40°). 

1.5 mm. in length, spire depressed, with the globose whorls in one plane 
to give a planorboid shape. Limacina scaphoidea Gould is this species. 

Family PERACLIDAE 
Genus Feracle Forbes 1844 

Shell fragile, with sinistral or left-handed whorls (resembling the freshwater pond snail, Physa); aperture very large and elongated; columella prolonged into an elongate rostrum; no umbilicus. Operculum thin, paucispiral, 
sifiistral and subcircular in outline. There are only two species in the genus. 
PeracUs Pelseneer is the same genus. 

Feracle reticulata Orbigny Reticulate Pteropod 

Figure 64g 

Worldwide, pelagic. (40° N. to 20° S.). 

4 mm. in length, brownish yellow, sinistral and with 4 whorls. Suture 
deep. The surface exhibits a raised hexagonal reticulation, the sides of the 
hexagons bearing a regular row of minute teeth. P. physoides Forbes and 
P. clathrata Eyd. and Soul, are the same. 

Feracle bispinosa Pelseneer Two-spined Pteropod

Atlantic, pelagic. (38° N. to 28° S.). 

7 mm. in length, milky-white, similar to reticulata, but with a wide,
