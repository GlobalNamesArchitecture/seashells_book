the only satisfactory methods of collecting deep-water species. In many 
instances larger and more perfect specimens of normally shallow-water species are found in moderately deep waters just offshore. 

Dredging, like fishing, is a science as M-ell as an art. It requires a basic 
knowledge of boats, equipment and bottom conditions. Firsthand experience 
is a necessity before satisfactory results can be obtained. It is also an expensive operation in which costs increase geometrically the deeper one dredges. 
Those who are financially willing to spend several hundred dollars in elaborate operations are urged to seek the advice of one of several of the Florida 
or California shell dredgers. However, very profitable collecting in depths 
less than loo feet may be undertaken from a rowboat at relatively little 
expense. 

One of the prime prerequisites of safe dredging is a healthy respect for 
the ocean and her many moods. Limit rowing operations to calm inlets and 
bays. Sudden squalls, high winds, swift currents and blistering sun on the 
open ocean are serious adversaries to even the "saltiest" fisherman. Prepare 
for each trip with care, and back your operations with a knowledge of local 
tides, currents, the weather and bottom conditions. 

There are many types of dredges, and the larger your boat and engine 
the more elaborate may be your dredge. For rowboat operations the simplest 
type consists of a triangular or rectangular iron frame with a pair of iron 
bridles which are tied together. A fine-meshed fishino- net is sewn to the
