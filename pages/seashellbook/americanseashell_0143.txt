About /4 inch in length. Characterized by the small, projecting, toothlike, frequently brownish spine located on the lower end of the columella. 
Base of shell with about 5 strong, spiral cords. Top of whorls with low, 
slanting, axial ribs. Color grayish white with beach-worn specimens often 
exhibiting flecks of purple-brown. Found abundantly among weeds in shallow, warm waters. 

Modulus carchedonius Lamarck, the Angled Modulus (Caribbean area) 
lives in deeper water, and differs in having the periphery of the shell wellangulated, the spiral cords smaller and neater, in lacking the strong, axial ribs, 
and in never having the columella tooth colored. Not too common.
