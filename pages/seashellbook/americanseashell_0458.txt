piece. 

Teredo navalis Linne Common Shipworm 

Both coasts of the United States. Europe and Africa. 

Shell like that in Bankia and subject to many minute variations. Each 
of the 2 calcareous pallets is spathate and compressed, but typically symmetrical. The leathery blade is urn-shaped, widening regularly from a stalk 
of medium length, then tapering somewhat toward the tip, which is decidedly 
excavated. The base of the blade is calcareous, but approximately the distal 
third is normally covered by a yellowish or brownish chitinous epidermis. 
A very common and destructive species found boring in wood.
