% inch in length, similar to jeffreysi, but snow-white and covered 
with numerous, small, opaque-white granules. Uncommon from 30 to 100 
fathoms. 

Genus Cardiojnya A. Adams 1864 

With strong, sharp radial ribs; fossette more vertical and prominent, 
otherwise like Cuspidaria. 

Cardioviya costellata Deshayes Costate Cuspidaria 

North Carolina to south Florida and the West Indies. 

% inch in length, fragile, with a short rostrum, and with a few prominent radial ribs just in front of the rostrum which gives the ventral margin 
of the valve in that area a scalloped edge. Anteriorly, the radial ribs are closer 
together, but weaker, and are rarely present at the anterior end of the shell. 
Additional ribs may develop in older specimens and become more even in 
size. (C. midticostata Verrill and Smith may be the old form and C. geirnna 
Verrill and Bush the young form.) Commonly dredged off eastern Florida. 



CUSPIDARIIDAE 477 

Cardio7nya pectinata Carpenter Pectinate Cuspidaria 

Puget Sound, Washington, to Panama. 

M inch in length; anterior end globular, bearing 8 to 12 strong radial 
ribs (there may be smaller ribs between the main ones). Posterior end drawnout like a short handle and bearing 2 to 4 weak, longitudinal riblets. Color 
dull-gray with a glossy, grayish white interior. Commonly dredged offshore. 



Consider the case of the oyster 

Which passes its time in the moisture. 

Of sex alternate. 

It chases no mate. 

But lives in a self-contained cloister.
