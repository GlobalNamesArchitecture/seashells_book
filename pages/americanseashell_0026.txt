may be smooth, furrowed, or lined with spines. As in most bivalves, some 
snails possess a jelly-like crystalline style which projects into one corner of 
the stomach and dissolves off digestive enzymes. The so-called "liver" of the 
snail which forms most of the upper part of the soft, coiled viscera is actually 
a digestive gland where food material is broken down and absorbed into the 
blood stream.

HOW THEY BREATHE 

Breathing by most aquatic marine snails takes place through the gills 
where oxygen is obtained from the sea water and where the waste gases are 
dissolved. The numerous gill leaflets are usually located on the inner side 
of the mantle. Except in the primitive snails with a pair of gills, water is 
brought into the mantle cavity through the siphonal canal or through the 
region to the left of the head. It then bathes the gills and passes out on the 
right side of the body. The current of water is maintained by thousands of 
microscopic, lashing, hair-like cilia mostly on the gill leaflets. 

Like the bivalves, the snails display a wide variety of types of gills. The 
most primitive groups, such as some of the Keyhole Limpets, Slit-shells, 
<tname>Pleurotomarias</tname> and abalones have two pairs of gills. They are of equal size 
in the Keyhole Limpets, but in some others the right one is considerably 
smaller. In the higher groups of snails, the left gill is the only one remaining. 
In the <tname>Cerithidea</tname> snails, the gills are reduced to mere stumps, and respiration 
takes place in the mantle skin itself. The sea slugs have lost their ctenidia 
but have evolved very complicated and beautiful gill-like organs on the sides 
and back of their bodies. Many of these gills have taken on the shape of 
miniature shrubs and trees. 

HOW THEY REPRODUCE 

The subject of reproduction among the gastropods is a fascinating study 
of many important phases of biology. Our final concepts of the formation of 
species, our understanding of zoogeography, distributional methods and the 
basis of sex determination are dependent on a fuller knowledge of reproduction. The manner of assuring fertilization of eggs, the various methods of 
egg-laying and brooding of young and the interesting types of larval development are horizons of research that are now being expanded. 

The gastropods exhibit nearly every possible modification of sexuality. 
Two of the three orders of snails, the opisthobranchs containing the sea slugs 
and the land snail pulmonates, combine a complete set of male and female 
organs in the same individual. The gonad produces both sperm and eggs, 
but there are separate ducts for the products of each sex. Despite the dual 
sex life, all mature individuals experience the mating instincts of both sexes, 
and during copulation there is a mutual exchange of sperm. In some sea 
slugs, the tectibranchs, several individuals may form rows or a ring of copulating snails. In some fresh-water pulmonates, self-fertilization is sometimes 
practiced, and some experimenters liave bred over ninety generations, extending over twenty years, without cross-fertilization between individuals. 

The marine gastropods contain representatives of several categories of
