Puget Sound to Lower California. 

% inch or less in length, similar to carpenteri but with a flatter spire, 
and smoothish, except for numerous incised, spiral lines producing very weak 
threads. Color dark, rosy-brown. A moderately common shallow-water 
species, sometimes found with carpe?iteri. A thorough anatomical and life 
history study of this genus is needed to ascertain the validity of these species.

% to M inch in length, moderately elongate, smoothish except for microscopic spiral grooves in some specimens. Color rose to brownish, sometimes whitish. Always with numerous small dots of pink, orange or a brownish color. Frequently with zigzag, axial bars of rose or brownish yellow. 
Often with irregular small spots or blotches of opaque-white. Umbilicus

Plate i-jT 
Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

Ys inch in length, spiral sculpture of numerous very small spiral cords, 
the largest being at the periphery of the whorl, thus giving the shell a slightly 
carinate shape. This carina is more pronounced in the early whorls and 
commonly bears a spiral row of tiny, white dots. Color variable, usually 
whitish gray with pink or brown axial mottlings and irregularly placed tiny 
dots of rose, yellow-brown or purplish brown. Umbilicus a mere chink. 
Operculum calcareous, convex, half smooth, the other half with fine, arched 
riblets. Common in shallow water among dead corals. 

<tname>Tricolia compta Gould</tname> Californian Banded Pheasant 

Crescent City, California, to the Gulf of California. 

/4 to H inch in length, resembling a moderately high-spired <tname>Littorina</tname>, 
but distinguished from that genus by its calcareous operculum. Shell smooth, 
in life covered by a thin gray-green, translucent periostracum. Characterized 
by the numerous, spiral lines of blackish green, red, brown or purplish which 
slant slightly downward, so that they are not parallel to the suture. Axial 
zigzag, wider bands are also present. Very abundant on eel-grass in shallow 
bays. Frequently washed ashore.
