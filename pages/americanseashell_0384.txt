This is the most common and most brightly hued Atlantic species. In 
quiet waters it may develop spine-like foliations to such an extent that it 
resembles the Spiny Oyster, <tname>Spondylus</tname>. Exterior variously colored: lemonyellow, reddish brown, deep- to dull-purple, orange, white, or a combination 
of these colors. Inner edges of the valves have tiny, axial ridges or crenulations. The scale-like fronds have minute radial lines. Compare with sinuosa.

Rarely over i inch in size. This species closely resembles the common 
J77acerophylla, but in place of numerous foliations there are low axial corrugations or wavy cords. The unattached valve may have a few short, flat 
spines. There are fine crenulations on the inner margins of the valves. The 
color is usually dull with darker specklings. In rocky areas they live in crevices and under stones. Commonly found attached to pen and ark shells.
