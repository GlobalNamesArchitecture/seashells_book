H to % inch in diameter, thin, almost circular, low and with the apex 
near the edge of the shell. Characterized by its tannish to mauve-white, 
glossy interior which has a shallow deck which is attached to the main 
part of the shell only along one side. The middle of the deck often has a

Variable in shape, rarely quite flat, sometimes high and arched. They may 
be corrugated if the individual has lived attached to a scallop or ribbed 
mussel. A common littoral species. When collecting on the west coast of 
Florida, do not confuse with <tname>C. maculosa</tname>. <tname>C. fornicata</tname> has been introduced 
to the West Coast of the United States.

Resembling <tname>C. fornicata</tname>, but often spotted with small, mauve-brown 
blotches and sometimes streaked. The edge of the deck is straight or only 
very slightly convex. There is an oval muscle scar on the inside of the shell 
just below and in front of the right anterior edge of the deck and the main 
shell. The young are very much like southern forms of <tname>C. convexa Say</tname>.
