than a few pinkish or yellowish forms, can boast of colorful shells; but in 
the East Indies such forms as <tname>Dentaliwn elephantinum Linne</tname> are brightly 
hued in various shades of emerald green and jade. Some species of Dentalium 
have a terminal pipe projecting out of the posterior end. 

There are only two families in the class <tname>Scaphopoda</tname> â€” the <tname>Dentaliidae</tname> 
and the <tname>Siphono dentaliidae</tname>. Both families are well-represented in our waters, 
the former by numerous species of <tname>Dentaliimt</tname>, the latter by members of the 
genus <tname>Cadulus</tname>. 

<tname>Dentaliidae</tname>: Shell tusk-shaped, increasing in size regularly with the greatest 
diameter at the mouth end. Foot conical. Central tooth of radula twice 
as wide as long. 

<tname>Siphonodentaliidae</tname>: Shell bulbous near the middle with the mouth end 
generally contracted. Foot vermiform, capable of expansion into a 
rosette-like disk at the end. Central tooth of radula almost square. 



CHAPTER V 



Collecting 
American Seashells 



Instructions for collecting seashells are much akin to revelations of the 
secrets of good cooking. Everyone has his favorite methods and, despite 
the most expert advice one may obtain from books, experience is the surest 
path to success. There are, however, a number of fundamentals which will 
help guide the collector in obtaining a representative series of our seashells 
with the least trouble. The hints offered here are more in the order of how 
collecting problems may be solved than a revelation of how and where to 
find rare specimens. 

The most successful collectors mix together four ingredients to obtain 
what appears to most of us "unusual luck" in finding good shells. These 
are a knowledge of the habits of mollusks, a familiarization with the physical 
conditions of the ocean and the seashore, a sensible choice of collecting equipment and, perhaps most important, a large proportion of perseverance. The 
first three of these may be acquired, to some degree at least, from books and 
from the advice of veteran collectors, but only keen observation in the field 
and many hours of trial collecting will develop satisfactory techniques. It 
is true, of course, that strolling the more productive beaches at certain times 
of year will produce encouraging results, but soon the common species have 
been collected and more often than not the remaining specimens are far 
from perfect. The moment a collector ceases to be a beachcomber and begins 
to search for living mollusks in their natural haunts he has opened unlimited 
possibilities of acquiring a remarkably beautiful and complete collection.

It is most surprising how many treasures within arm's reach are lost to 
the uninitiated. A waterlogged board if kicked aside may be found to contain three or four kinds of interesting wood-boring clams; a rock unturned
