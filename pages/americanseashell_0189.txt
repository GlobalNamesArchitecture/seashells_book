3 inches in length, with a rather long siphonal canal, and bearing 8 long 
axial ribs (or former varices) which are blade-like and are curled into long 
upswept, large spines. With or without small, low, spiral threads which may 
be more pronounced on the last whorl. Color yellowish to brownish white. 
Sometimes with subdued, wide brown lines. The form pinnata Dall is a 
smaller, 8 to 9 ribbed, spirally threaded variant from the same region. Uncommon from 21 to 74 fathoms.

2 to 3 inches in length, similar to the typical cerrosensis, but with 7 ribs, 
sturdier shell, with less development of the blade-like ribs, and often with 
more brownish coloration. Formerly thought to be Boreotrophon triangularis Cpr. Moderately common offshore, sometimes cast ashore.

I to 3 inches in length. The long, slender siphonal canal bears 3 rows of 
long and slender spines. Color drab-white, sometimes a pale yellowish pink 
between the varices. Each varix has 3 to 4 sharp, long spines. Uncommonly 
dredged in moderately deep water. Considered a collector's item. Do not 
confuse with the less rare Murex tryoni Hidalgo of southeast Florida and the 
West Indies, which is much the same except that it lacks spines all down the 
siphonal canal and is almost smooth between the varices. Compare also with 
the next species which is common.
