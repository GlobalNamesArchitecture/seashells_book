Atlantic and Pacific, pelagic. (N. Lat. 41° to S. Lat. 35°). 

8 to 10 mm. in length. A drawn-out, slender shell similar to acicula, 
but with its narrow end hooked to one side. The amount of bend of hook

is smooth, and with a dorsal groove not parallel to the axis of the shell, but 
slightly oblique, turning from left to right, with only the anterior extremity 
(which ends in a rostrum) in the median line. There is only one species in 
the genus and it is world-wide in distribution.
