Cape Cod, Massachusetts, south to Brazil. Indo-Pacific. (N. Lat. 42° 
to S. Lat. 40°).

long as wide. Spiral lines only around the umbilicus.

Figure 6^d 

New York to southern Brazil. (N. Lat. 39° to S. Lat. 40°). 

2 mm. in length, spire high, shell twice as long as wide. Umbilicus very 
indistinct. Lip fragile and often broken. 6 to 7 whorls. 

<tname>Spiratella inflata Orbigny</tname> Planorbid Pteropod 

Figure 64h 

Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to Argentina. (N. Lat. 42° to S. Lat. 40°). 

1.5 mm. in length, spire depressed, with the globose whorls in one plane 
to give a planorboid shape.<tname> Limacina scaphoidea Gould</tname> is this species. 

Family <tname>PERACLIDAE</tname> 
Genus <tname>Feracle Forbes 1844</tname> 

Shell fragile, with sinistral or left-handed whorls (resembling the freshwater pond snail, <tname>Physa</tname>); aperture very large and elongated; columella prolonged into an elongate rostrum; no umbilicus. Operculum thin, paucispiral, 
sifiistral and subcircular in outline. There are only two species in the genus. 
<tname>PeracUs Pelseneer</tname> is the same genus. 

<tname>Feracle reticulata Orbigny</tname> Reticulate Pteropod

Worldwide, pelagic. (40° N. to 20° S.). 

4 mm. in length, brownish yellow, sinistral and with 4 whorls. Suture 
deep. The surface exhibits a raised hexagonal reticulation, the sides of the 
hexagons bearing a regular row of minute teeth. <tname>P. physoides Forbes</tname> and 
<tname>P. clathrata Eyd. and Soul</tname>, are the same.
