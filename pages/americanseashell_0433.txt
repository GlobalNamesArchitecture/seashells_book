minutely denticulate. Color variable and commonly very bright, especially 
inside: white, yellow, pink, purple, bluish, mauve and commonly with rays 
of darker shades. 

The subspecies roemeri Philippi (pi. 3oq) is very common along the 
Texas shores. The posterior end is blunter, the whole shell not so elongate, 
and the ventral margin sags down.

smooth, even at the blunt, posterior end. Only 2 color phases: yellowish 
white or with weak purplish rays. Subsequent biological studies may show 
that this common beach species is a subspecies or cold-water form of variabilis. Young specimens of variabilis from several southern states look suspiciously like this so-called species. 

<tname>Donax tu7indus Philippi</tname> Fat Gulf Donax 

Northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. 

% to /4 inch in length, very obese, somewhat trigonal in shape, with its 
beaks swollen and posterior end strongly truncate. Threads on the blunt 
posterior end are heavily beaded, sometimes giving a cancellate appearance. 
Narrow anterior end commonly with distinct, microscopic, distantly spaced, 
incised, concentric lines. Color whitish with bluish, yellowish or pinkish 
undertones. Rarely, if ever, rayed. Uncommon. Found in 2 to 3 feet of 
water. 

<tname>Donax denticulatus Linne</tname> (pi. 3 op) from the southwest Caribbean has 
been erroneously recorded from our shores. It is i inch in length and characterized by 2 curved, low ridges on the posterior slope of each valve and 
by microscopic pin-points on the sides of the valves, 

<tname>Donax striates Linne</tname> also a lower West Indian species is as large, but 
characterized by a flat to slightly concave posterior slope which bears numerous fine radial threads.

San Luis Obispo, California, to Mexico. 

Common jorm: % inch in length, fairly obese, truncate at the posterior 
end where the beaks are located. Shell glossy, smooth, except for numerous, 
microscopic, axial threads at the anterior end. Exterior cream to white with 
variable color rays of light-tan. Margins of valves commonly flushed with 
purple. Interior stained with purple or bluish brown. Common on beaches, 
especially in the north. Kno\\^n locally as the Bean Clam. 

Small jorm: Yi inch in length, slightly more obese, without the color 
rays in most cases. Common, especially in the south.
