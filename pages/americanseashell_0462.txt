<tname>Pandora bilirata Conrad</tname> (Alaska to Lower California. Dredged) is 
half as large, not rostrate posteriorly, and with 2 strong radial ribs on the 
posterior dorsal margin of the left valve. 

<tname>Pafidora grantilata Dall</tname> (Santa Barbara south to La Paz, Mexico) is 
much like bilirata, but half its size, more elongate, and the 2 radial ribs are 
granulated. 



Family <tname>THRACIIDAE</tname> 
Genus <tname>Thracia Blainville 1824</tname> 

Shells up to 4 inches in size, thin, chalky in texture, beaks so close that 
the right one becomes punctured by the left beak; ligament external; shell 
commonly moderately rostrate at the posterior end; right valve fatter than 
the left. 



<tname>Thracia conradi Couthouy</tname> Conrad's Thracia 

Plate 2 8y 

Nova Scotia to Long Island Sound, New York. 

3 to 4 inches in length, about % as high. Valves obese and chalky-white. 
Hinge without teeth, only thickened considerably behind the beak and below the large, wide, external ligament. Right beak always punctured by the 
beak in the left valve. Pallial sinus U-shaped but not very deep. Posterior 
end of valves shghtly rostrate and with a weak radial ridge. Rarely washed 
ashore. Not uncommon offshore and down to 150 fathoms. 



<tname>Thracia trapezoides Conrad</tname> Common Pacific Thracia 

Alaska to Redondo Beach, California. 

2 inches in length and not quite so high; thin, chalky, and with the 
posterior end broadly rostrate. The beak of the right valve has a hole punctured in it by the beak of the left valve. The posterior rostrated part of the 
valve is set off by a broad, radial, depressed furrow which is bordered by a 
low, rounded, radial ridge. Color drab, grayish white. Commonly dredged 
off the west coast. Compare with <tname>T. curta Conrad</tname>. 



472 American Seashells 

<tname>Thracia curta Conrad</tname> Short Western Thracia 

Alaska to Lower California. 

I to 1% inches in length, very similar to trapezoides, but suboval and 
lacking the prominence of rostration. It is very close in shape to our illustration of the Atlantic <tname>T. comadi</tname>. A moderately common species. John 
Q. Burch reports that it is relatively abundant at San Onofre, California, 
in the rubbly reef at extreme low tides. It has also been taken from wharf 
pilings, and it is commonly dredged in over 20 fathoms on shale bottoms.
