Indies, they would have marveled at the abundance of our Wide-mouthed 
Purpura, <tname>Fiirpura patuJa</tname>, and its large production of rich violet dye. Collectors who have put live specimens in a cloth bag will recall the bright, durable 
stains that have appeared soon afterward in the fabric. Many shell collections 
contain this species in which specimens still retain purple stains on the outside of the shell. The subspecies, pansa, was used in prehistoric times for 
dyeing cotton on the northwest coast of South America and the west coast 
of Central America. Even today the Tehuantepec Indians of Mexico use the 
<tname>Pansa Purpura</tname> for dyeing cotton threads. The natives have put into effect a 
plan of conservation and, instead of crushing the shells, they carefully "milk" 
the living specimens by pressing in the animal to squeeze out the juice. They 
then return the mollusks to the rocks and revisit them at a later date. The 
cotton threads are individually drawn through the liquid to obtain the fast 
dye. 

In 1 7 1 1 Reaumur accidentally discovered that the t^g capsules of <tname>Thais 
lapilhts</tname> were a simpler and more abundant source for the purple dye. As 
Miirex egg capsules mature, they take on a characteristic purplish hue. It is 
possible that this was the secret, if such existed, that the Tyrians guarded so 
jealously. Latest experiments indicate that the purple dye is a derivative of 
indigo containing bromide. 

Probably most, if not all, species of <tname>Murex</tname>, <tname>Thais</tname>, <tname>P^irpiira</tname> and other 
members of the <tname>Muricid</tname> family produce this bromide, dye-giving secretion. 
It has been suggested by some workers that this secretion serves as an anesthetic on various oysters, clams and chitons upon \\'hich they prey. However, the presence of purpurase in the Qgg capsules does not favor this view. 
In addition, the dye-producing gland is closely associated with the reproductive system and not with the salivary glands or any other organs of the 
proboscis. Many other carnivorous families which attack other living mollusks in a manner similar to that of the A4uricids do not produce this dve. 

Inks and dyes are produced by many other mollusks, the <tname>Sepia</tname> cuttlefish 
being an outstanding example. Purple dye has been recorded in the Purple 



Ma7J and Mollusks 15 

Sea Snails, <tname>]anthina</tname>, in the Wentletraps, <tname>Epitonium</tname>, in some of the Mitras 
and Olive shells and in the sea hares, <tname>Aplysia</tname>. These substances are known 
to be irritating to fish and other would-be predators, and its purpose as a 
defense mechanism seems most likely. Probably future experiments will show 
that the egg capsules of <tname>Mjirex</tname>, loaded as they are with purpurase, are distasteful to fish and have an unusually high survival value. 



CHAPTER II 

Life of the Snails 



The private lives of the snails, or gastropods as they are more correctly 
called, are almost as varied as the different kinds of seashells that are found 
along our beaches. More than half of the 80,000 species of existing snails live 
under marine conditions, the remainder being air-breathing land species or 
inhabitants of fresh water. In their evolutionary struggle for existence, they 
have shown an amazing diversity in adapting themselves to nearly every condition found in the sea. There are snails that creep, jump, swim, burrow, 
some that are permanently anchored to rocks and a few that live inside other 
marine creatures. In a few cases, as in some conchs and top shells (<tname>Troclms</tname>), 
the snail may play host to small fish and tiny crabs. 

Gastropods have experimented in all manner of forms, colors and sizes. 
In size they vary from the two-foot-long Horse Conch of Florida {<tname>Pleuroploca gigantea</tname>) to the microscopic <tname>Vitrinellas</tname> that scarcely exceed the size 
of a grain of sugar. Some species display unusual ornamentation and, as in
