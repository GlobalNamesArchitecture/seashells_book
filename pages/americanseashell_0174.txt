^ inch in diameter, planorboid, compressed from above, fragile, transparent and glassy. Later whorls openly coiled but connected by a sharp

Atlantic warm waters; pelagic. 

Body up to 10 inches in length, tissues transparent; proboscis large and 
purple. Shell K the size of the animal, cap-shaped, very thin, fragile and 
transparent. Its apex is hooked. The shell is borne on top of the animal. This 
is a valuable collector's item, and in former years it brought fancy prices. 
Formerly known as <tname>C. mediterrafiea Lamarck</tname> and erroneously attributed 
under that name to Peron and Lesueur.
