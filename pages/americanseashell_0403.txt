2 to 4 inches in length, oblong-oval, obese. Resembling <tname>Mercejiaria 
campechiensis</tname>, but characterized by numerous, fine, radial riblets which cause 
the sharp, concentric ribs to be serrated or beaded. Each side of the lunule 
is bounded by a long, deep, narrow furrow. Posterior muscle scar usually 
stained brown. Moderately common in shallow water in sand.

1% inches in length, externahy very much hke a small <tname>Mercenaria 
campechiensis</tname>, but not as elongate and with more distinct, concentric riblets.

pallial sinus, by the very thick margin of the shell, and in the left valve by 
the presence of a button-like anterior lateral "tooth." Exterior whitish. 
Dredged occasionally from 40 to 70 fathoms. Considered a collector's item.
