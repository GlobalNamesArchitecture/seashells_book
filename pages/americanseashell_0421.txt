/4 to % inch in length, similar to mera, but more pointed posteriorly, 
whitish with a faint pinkish blush, and with very numerous, microscopic, 
concentric lines of growth. The pallial sinus line in this species runs forward 
nearly to the anterior muscle scar and then drops almost vertically toward 
the ventral margin of the shell before continuing posteriorly. In 77tera and 
promera, the pallial sinus line toward the anterior muscle scar, makes a 
U-shaped turn, and then runs posteriorly but does not join the lower pallial 
line until about the middle of the ventral region of the valve. Common in 
shallow water. 

Tellina texana Dall Say's Tellin 

New Jersey to south half of Florida and Cuba. 

% inch in length, white with a faint opalescent sheen. Extremely close 
to agilis, but distinguished by the heavy, enamel-white finish on the inside 
of the shell and i or i fairly distinct radial grooves running from the posterior muscle scar to the ventral margin of the valve. The faint pallial sinus 
just touches the anterior muscle scar. Fairly common. T. sayi Dall (Dec. 
1900) is a synonym of T. texana Dall (Nov. 1900). T. poUta Say (not 
Spengler) is also this species. 

Tellina sybaritica Dall Dall's Dwarf Tellin

y4 to Vs inch in length, very elongate, shiny, with quite strong, numerous concentric threads or cut lines. Color varying from translucent-white, 
yellowish, pinkish to bright watermelon-red. Our smallest and most colorful 
Tellin, and plentiful from i to 60 fathoms. It somewhat resembles young 
alternata, but the latter are smoother and have a short instead of long posterior lateral tooth in the left valve, and has no lateral lamina in the left valve.
