Coos Bay, Oregon, to Lower California. 

6 inches in length, oval, and fairly deep. Outer surface smoothish, except for coarse growth lines. Usually 5 to 8 holes are open. External color 
bluish to greenish black. Interior pearly-white. A fairly abundant, edible 
species although not fished commercially to any great extent. A littoral species which clings to rocks between tide marks. Some shells may lack the 
holes (unnecessarily named <tname>H. c. holzneri Hemphill</tname>, <tname>H. c. imperforata Dall</tname> 
and <tname>H. c. lusus Finlay</tname>). A subspecies, <tname>H. c. calif orniensis Swainson</tname>, occurs 
on Guadalupe Island and is characterized by 1 2 to 16 very small holes. <tname>H. c. 
bonita Orcutt</tname> is the same as this subspecies. <tname>H. c. splendidula Williamson</tname> is 
the typical cracherodi.

Northern California to Lower California. 

10 to 12 inches in length, oval, rather flattened. Outer surface rather 
rough, dull brick-red with a narrow red border around the edge of the shell. 
Interior iridescent blues and greens, with a large central muscle scar. 3 to 4

holes are open. Fished commercially below 20 feet, especially between Monterey and Point Conception. The legal minimum size for sportsmen is 7 
inches, and the catch is limited to 5 specimens per person per day. This is 
a popular food and, when polished on the outside, makes an attractive mantel 
piece.
