I % inches in length, equally wide, with about 4 whorls. Characterized 
by 2 strong, spiral carinae at the periphery, by the wide, flattened columella 
and by the flaky, brown periostracum which is grossly spinose on the carinae. 
Uncommon just ofl^shore in cold water.

I inch in length, similar to <tname>T. bicarinata</tname> but smaller, with a much heavier 
shell, weakly carinate with other numerous, uneven, spiral threads, and with 
a thin, grayish periostracum. Both this species and bicarinata are easily distinguished from the more common cancellata by their much shorter spires and 
large flaring apertures. Uncommon just offshore.

% inch in size, cap-shaped, white to cream, and with a very large, circular to slightly oval aperture, i /4 to 2 whorls. Spire small, usually tightly 
coiled, but sometimes partially free. Early whorls usually with small spiral 
cords, but these are frequently worn smooth. Sculpture of small, irregular, 
rounded growth lines which are crossed by numerous spiral cords which 
may be rounded or sharp. Periostracum thick, light-brown, with spirally arranged rows of small tufts. Muscle scar within the aperture is horseshoeshaped with the swollen end just inside the columella. Uncommon on rocks 
just below low water. I believe that <tname>C intortus Lamarck</tname> is merely a variant 
of this species. Compare with <tname>Hipponix antiquata</tname> which is much heavier, 
lacks the spiral cords and is more coarsely sculptured.
