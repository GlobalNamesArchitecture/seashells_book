poisonous micro-organisms. Prior to the advent of ships with metal hulls no 
vessel on the seas was safe from the borings of molluscan "shipworms." 
Many ships have disappeared at sea as a result of being weakened by the 
attacks of these creatures. Even today damage to the extent of millions of 
dollars is done every year to wharf pilings, small craft, and hemp lines by 
these bivalves. In many parts of the world the health of millions is seriously 
menaced by mollusks. It was not until the turn of the century when modern 
research was directed toward tropical diseases that the full importance of 
snails as carriers was appreciated. Six major parasitic diseases have been 
shown to be transmitted by fresh-water mollusks. Thousands of people die 
each year in China and Egypt from the blood-fluke disease alone. No fatal 
snail-borne disease is present in North America proper, but visitors to the 
West Indies and northern South America are warned to keep out of ponds 
and flooded ditches in these regions. 

In other respects, mollusks are of minor medical importance. A number 
of parasitic diseases of sea birds and fish are carried by marine shells, such as 
the periwinkles <tname>Littorina</tname> and <tname>Tectarius</tname> and other shore species. During certain seasons of the year, usually in late summer, these snail hosts shed thousands of microscopic larval worms into the sea water. Although normally 
destined to penetrate the skin of birds, these tiny creatures sometimes attack 
man and cause an uncomfortable rash or "swimmer's itch" which is often 
mistaken for jellyfish sting.

Atlantic, can inflict a serious, and at times fatal, sting. The venom leaves the poison
