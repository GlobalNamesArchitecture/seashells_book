Plate 39a 

Lower Florida Keys and the West Indies. 

1% inches in length, similar to latilirata, but not so heavy, with 10 to 12 
smaller, concentric ribs which are thin at their ends. From a side view, the 
dorsal margin of the lunule is very concave. Not very common in the United 
States.

North Carolina to Florida and to Texas. 

I inch in length, very thick and solid, with 5 to 7 large, bulbous, concentric ribs, usually rounded, but may also be sharply shelved on top. The 
ribs are not thin and flattened at their ends. Lunule heart-shaped, and, from 
a side view, its dorsal margin is almost straight. Surface of shell glossy, cream 
with rose and brown mottlings. Rather uncommon offshore in about 20 
fathoms.

Plate 39) 

South half of Florida to Texas. 

% to % inch in length, about % to ^ as high, pointed into a sharp, 
wedge-like rostrum at the posterior end. Lunule oval to slightly heart-shaped 
and faintly impressed. Wide, shallow escutcheon bordered by a weak ridge. 
Beaks tiny and inrolled. Sculpture of small, but distinct, rounded, concentric 
ribs which are more prominent near the beaks. Color variable: glossy-cream, 
white or tan with brown or purple rays of fine specklings. Interior white, 
purple or brown. Brackish water specimens are dwarfed. A common sandy 
shore species. 

<tname>A. brasiliana Gmelin</tname> (West Indian Pointed Venus) which is twice as 
large, less elongate, and with the concentric ribs extending over into the 
escutcheon area, has been erroneously reported from the United States. 
Common in the West Indies and south to Brazil.
