5 mm. in diameter, planorboid, well-compressed, 4 whorls, opaque-white, 
with a glossy sheen. Outer surface covered with numerous, crowded, spiral, 
incised lines. Umbilicus with rounded sides, deep, rather narrow. 50 to 100 
fathoms. Locally common.

<tname>VITRINELLIDAE</tname> 139 

Vs inch in diameter, strong, opaque-white, depressed, 4 whorls. Top of 
whorls rounded, slightly concave just below the fine suture; bearing 5 or 6 
major, smooth, spiral threads on top with numerous, much finer threads between. Periphery bordered above and below by a major cord. Umbilicus 
widely funnel-shaped, deep. Outer lip crenulate above. Not uncommon in 
shallow water. One of our largest American Vitrinellid species. Provisionally 
placed in this subgenus.

<tname>Fseudomalaxis nobilis \^errill</tname> Noble False Dial 

Virginia to southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

% inch in diameter, dull-white, planorboid, with a very flat spire and a 
wide concave, non-umbilicate base. Periphery of shell flat, bordered above 
and below by one or two spiral cords of small beads. Aperture squarish. 
Operculum round, multispiral with a chitinous pimple on the inside. A rare 
and choice collector's item. Deep water. 70 fathoms. 

<tname>Fseudomalaxis balesi Pilsbry and McGinty</tname> Bales' False Dial 

Palm Beach and along the Lower Keys, Florida. 

1.8 mm. in diameter, 3 to 4 whorls, semitranslucent-white to burnt 
sienna. Sculpture of fine, spiral striae and strong, widely spaced, radial ribs. 
Peripheral zone flattened or concave between 2 projecting nodulose keels. 
Under rocks. Moderately common to rare. This genus was formerly placed 
in the family <tname>Architectonicidae</tname>. 

Genus <tname>Teinostoma H. and A. Adams 1854</tname> 

Shells usually about 2 to 3 mm. in diameter, depressed, glossy, white, 
usually smooth, and with an umbilical callus. They are very distinctive little 
shells, but require a high-powered lens for their inspection. We have figured 
only one species, but have included a key from the work of Pilsbry and 
McGinty (1945) (see pi. lyy). 

Key to the Florida <tname>Teinostoma</tname> 

1. Umbilical callus encircled by a keel. 1.7 mm.; Palm Beach to Cape Florida. 

1 2 to 50 faths. <tname>T. (Ajinulicalhis) lituspalmarum Pils. and McG.</tname> 

2. Umbilical callus and columellar lobe not closing the umbilicus completely; 

3 mm.; southeast Forida. 80 fms
