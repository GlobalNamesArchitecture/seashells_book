South half of Florida and the West Indies. 

1% to 3 inches in length, moderately inflated to flattish, thin-shelled 
and brittle. There is a small, thin, flat ligament at the center of the hinge. 
Exterior tan with mottlings or rays of purplish brown or black. Rarely

buried, and there is a mass of byssal threads attached to small stones or fragments of shells. The broad end of the shell projects above the surface of the 
sand an inch or so. In the genus Pinna, there is a weak groove running down 
the middle of each valve. In <tname>Atrina</tname>, this character is absent.

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

4 to 9 inches in length, relatively narrow, thin-shelled and with a 
central, radial ridge in the middle of the valve which is more conspicuous 
at the pointed or hinge end. With or without 10 radial rows of moderately 
large, scale-like spines. Color usually a light orangish to translucent-amber. 
Rare in Florida but common in the Bahamas. This is the only Pinna in the 
western Atlantic. <tname>P. nidis Linne</tname> is apparently a Mediterranean and West 
African species which is heavier and darker red. The name <tname>P. haiidigjjobilis 
Karsten</tname> is invalid, as are all this author's names.
