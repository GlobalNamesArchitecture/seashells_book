I /4 inches in length, irregularly sculptured with 2 spiral rows of blunt 
spines, one on the shoulder, the other at the center of the body whorl. Color 
dirty-gray to dull mottled brown. Interior of aperture whitish but generally 
margined with spots of dark-brown along the outer lip. Parietal wall glossywhite. This species is smaller and more nodulose than floridana and always 
has a white aperture. Erroneously called <tname>Thais imdata Lamarck</tname> which is an 
Indo-Pacific species. 

Three confusing species are often found together in southern Florida. 
The young of <tname>Canthariis tinctits</tname> (see p. 233) has the lower third of its white 
columella turned away (to the left) 20 degrees from the axis of the shell, and 
its early whorls in the spire are not shouldered. <tname>Thais haemastoina floridana</tname> 
is characterized by its almost straight, cream to orange columella, and by the 
numerous raised cream or white spiral ridges on the inside of the outer lip. 
Thais rustica has a stouter, white columella which is slightly twisted and 
purple-stained at the lower, inner corner. Its outer lip teeth occur in groups 
of 2 or 3 and near the edge of the lip are stained by heavy blotches of purplebrown.

Jupiter Inlet, Florida, to the West Indies. Bermuda. 

I to 2 inches in length, heavy, and coarsely sculptured with two spiral 
rows of large, blunt spines. Parietal wall tinted with lavender, mauve or rose. 
Interior of aperture glossy-white. Exterior grayish white with mottlings of 
black or dull brown. Columella with a small but distinct ridge at the base 
which forms the margin of the siphonal canal. This is an abundant species 
where intertidal rocks are exposed to the ocean surf.

with rounded, spiral ridges. Sometimes imbricated with small scales (form 
named inibricata Lamarck, pi. 256). Color usually dull-white, but sometimes 
yellowish, orange or brownish. Rarely with dark-brown or blackish spiral 
bands. This species has also been known as <tname>Nucella lapillus</tname>. For biology see 
H. B. Moore (1936 and 1938).
