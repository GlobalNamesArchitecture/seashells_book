Bolinas Bay, California, to Lower California. 

I to I H inches in length. Very thin, fragile and translucent. A4oderately elongate. Shell whitish tan, with broad, indistinct, radial rays of darker 
tan or rosy purplish. Periostracum thin, ohve-green and varnish-like. Moderately common in sand at low tide to 25 fathoms. This species can be 
distinguished from the young of<tname> S. patula</tname> by its narrower and higher internal 
rib which crosses the shell at right-angles, and in being more arcuate on its 
ventral margin.

<tname>SOLENIDAE</tname> 443 

5 to 6 inches in length, oval-oblong in shape, laterally compressed and 
moderately thin. Periostracum varnish-like and olive-green. Interior glossy 
and whitish with a purplish flush. Internal rib under teeth descending obliquely toward the anterior end. Animal without dark coloration. The 
variety nuttalli Conrad is a synonym. Do not confuse with <tname>5. alta</tname>. An abundant, edible species found in mud and sand on ocean beaches. 

<tname>Siliqua alta Dall</tname> Dall's Razor Clam 

Arctic Ocean to Cook's Inlet, Alaska. Russia. 

4 to 5 inches in length, similar to panda, but chalky-white inside, more 
truncate at both ends, a heavier shell, and with a stronger, narrower and 
vertical (not oblique) rib on the inside. <tname>5. viedia Sowerby</tname> from the same 
region may possibly be the young of this species, although it is blushed with 
purple inside. <tname>5. alta</tname> is common and edible. 

Genus <tname>Ensis Schumacher 1817</tname> 

The Jackknife Clams closely resemble Solen, but the left valve has 2 
vertical, cardinal teeth, and each valve has a long, low posterior tooth.

Labrador to South Carolina. Florida? 

Up to 10 inches in length, 6 times as long as high, moderately curved 
and with sharp edges. Shell white, covered with a thin, varnish-like, brownish-green periostracum. Common on sand-flats in New England. Edible. 

<tname>Ensis minor Dall</tname> from both sides of Florida to Texas rarely exceeds 3 
inches in length, is more fragile, relatively longer, and is more pointed at 
the free end (not the end with the teeth). Internally it has purplish stains. 
Moderately common between tide marks. Some workers consider this a subspecies of directus. <tname>E. megistus Pilsbry and McGinty</tname> are probably 5 -inchlong specimens of minor.
