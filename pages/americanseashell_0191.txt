Figure 45a 

North Carolina to the Lesser Antilles. 

I to 1/4 inches in length. Spines frondose and long, with webbing in 
between which is exquisitely sculptured with scale-like lamellations. Color 
grayish white to cream. This is probably the rarest of our eastern Murex 
species. Recently, one specimen was dredged oif northeast Florida in a few 
fathoms of water. 

Subgenus <tname>Chicoreus Montfort 18 10</tname> 
<tname>Murex brevifrons Lamarck</tname> West Indian Murex 

Plate loa 

Lower Florida Keys and the West Indies. 

3 to 6 inches in length. Numerous, stout, fairly long spines on the 
varices which arch backwards and bear sharp fronds. Raised, spiral lines 
prominent between the varices. Color variable from cream to dark-brown. 
Uncommon in the Lower Keys, but fairly common to abundant in the West 
Indies. Percy Morris (1951, pi. 14, fig. i) labels this species as <tname>Murex 
fiorifer</tname>.

frondose, scaly spines bordering the outer lip and siphonal canal. Top spine 
sometimes twice as long as the others. Color dark-brown, light-brown, or 
whitish and, in the latter case, the nuclear whorls at the spire are pinkish. 
Usually I axial low ridge between each varix, although occasionally with 
more and smaller axial ribs. 

The Lace Murex is one of Florida's most common species in this genus. 
It lives in a wide variety of habitats from mangrove, muddy areas to protected 
rocks and frequently in clear, sandy areas. The ecological variety, which 
is whitish and with reduced spines, was named arenarius by Clench and 
Farfante. This species differs from the 4 to 5 inch-long <tname>M. brevifrons</tname> in 
being smaller, in having closely crowded scaly spines, and in having a round 
instead of elongate operculum. For many years this species was called rufus 
Lamarck 1822 (not rufus Montagu 1803).
