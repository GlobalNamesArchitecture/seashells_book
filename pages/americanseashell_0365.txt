3 to 4 inches in size. Spines 2 or less inches in length, usually standing 
fairly erect. Color variable: white with yellow unbones, red or purple; 
sometimes all rose, all cream or all pink. The young are much less spinose, 
and might be confused with Chama which, however, does not have the balland-socket type of hinge. Beautiful and large specimens are found clinging

to old wrecks in fairly deep water. Perfect specimens have recently sold for

usually bent over. Color variable, and usually more brilliant than the Atlantic 
species. A popular, and now fairly high-priced collector's item. Often found 
on beaches with their spines worn off. They live in fairly deep water attached to rocks and wrecks.
