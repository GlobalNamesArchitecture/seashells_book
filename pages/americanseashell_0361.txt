Alaska to off San Diego, California. 

2 X.0 1V2 inches in size; with microscopic reticulations between the ribs 
either near the beaks or the margins of the valves. Left valve (without the 
byssal notch) with numerous primary ribs, each bearing 3 rows of spines, 
and with a secondary spined rib between. Right valve flattish, usually lightercolored, and with fewer ribs which are smoothish, rounded and inclined to 
be grouped in pairs. The reticulate sculpturing is best seen on this side.
