Nova Scotia to Florida, Texas and the West Indies. 

4 to 6 mm. in length, solid, oblong with its spire moderately elevated, 
but almost invariably eroded. Glossy smooth, except for microscopic growth 
lines. Outer lip thin, advanced above. Columella of a single, raised, strong 
spiral ridge. Suture slightly channeled. Nucleus (when present) very small 
and pimple-like. Color white to cream, commonly with dark, rust-brown 
staining. <tname>Acteocina candei Orbigny</tname> is probably only a southern representative of this species. A common shallow-water species which was formerly 
placed in the genus <tname>Acteocina</tname>.

5 to 100 fathoms. <tname>R. bushi Dall</tname> comes from deep water off North Carolina. 
It is larger, with a long apical process and with a long, chink-like umbilicus. 
The genus <tname>Volvulella Newton 1891</tname> is <tname>Rhizoriis</tname>.
