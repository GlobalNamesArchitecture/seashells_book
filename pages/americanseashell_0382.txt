Alaska to southern California. 

2 to 2% inches in length, oval to circular and slightly inflated. With 
strongly raised, concentric threads about Viq inch apart. Shell chalky-gray 
to white, overlaid by a thin, greenish-brown periostracum. Fairly commonly 
dredged from 8 to 75 fathoms. The Tertiary fossil species acutilineatus Conrad may be the same. 

Genus <tname>Anodontia Link 1807</tname> 

Shell large, obese, fairly thin and subcircular in outline. Hinge without 
distinct teeth. Anterior muscle scar long and parallels the pallial line.

North Carolina to Florida, the Gulf States and West Indies. 

1% to 2 inches in length, oval to circular, inflated and fairly strong. 
Hinge with very weak teeth, the posterior lateral being the most distinct. 
Exterior dull-white with weak, irregular concentric growth Hues. Interior 
with a strong blush of yellowish orange. A common species used in the 
shellcraft business. This is <tname>Lucina chrysostoma Philippi</tname>.

2 to 4 inches in length, very similar to<tname> A. alba</tname>, but with a more chalky 
shell, never with orange color, interior usually pustulose, and the long, anterior muscle scar juts away from the pallial line at an angle of about 30 
degrees instead of paralleling it as in alba. An uncommon species, commonly 
confused with alba. It lives down to 50 fathoms but at times is washed ashore. 
<tname>A, schrammi Crosse</tname> is this species. 

Genus <tname>Codakia Scopoli 1777</tname> 

Shell large, orbicular, moderately compressed. Hinge of right valve with 
a prominent anterior lateral which is typically close to the cardinals (an anterior, a posterior and a middle cardinal). Hinge of left valve with a large 
double anterior lateral, only 2 cardinals, and with a small, double posterior 
lateral.

Florida to Texas and the West Indies. 

2 % to 3 % inches in length, slightly less in height, well-compressed, more 
or less orbicular in outline, thick and strong. Beaks and /4 inch of subsequent 
growth smoothish. Remainder of the shell roughly sculptured by numerous 
coarse radial threads which are crossed by finer concentric threads. This 
commonly gives the radial ribs a beaded appearance. Exterior white. Interior white to pale-lemon, commonly with a rose tinge on the ends of the
