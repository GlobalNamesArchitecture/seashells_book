cold water. This is <tname>H. rugosa Linne</tname> and pholadis Linne. 

â–  <tname>Hiatella striata Fleuriau</tname> {<tname>H. galUcana Lamarck</tname> and rugosa of some 
authors) is almost indistinguishable in the adult form from arctic a. The 
young, however, in striata do not have the two radial spinose ribs. This 
species breeds in winter, while arctica breeds in summer. The eggs are pinkish 
cream, while those of arctica are red. It nearly always bores into stone. 

Genus <tname>Cyrtodaria Daudin 1799</tname> 
<tname>Cyrtodaria siliqiia Spengler</tname> Northern Propeller Clam 

Labrador to Rhode Island. 

2 to 3 inches in length, about H as high. Gapes at both ends, but more 
so posteriorly where the large siphonal snout projects out about an inch. 
Beaks hardly noticeable, placed slightly toward the anterior end. The 
strong, wide ligament is external at the very anterior end of the dorsal margin. Shell chalky, white with a bluish tint. The valves are thick-shelled, with 
a coarse callus inside. The valves are slightly twisted in propeller fashion. 
Hinge a simple bar with a fairly large bulbous swelling under the ligament. 
In life, the periostracum is light-brown, glossy, smooth and covers the entire exterior. Dried valves soon lose the flaky, blackened periostracum. 
Moderately common offshore down to 90 fathoms. On occasion, found in 
fish stomachs. 

A similar species, <tname>Cyrtodaria kurriana Dunker</tname>, is found in arctic waters 
along the shores at low tide. It is 3 times as long as high, hardly twisted 
and rarely exceeds 1% inches in length. Uncommon in collections. 

Genus <tname>Fanomya Gray 1857</tname> 
<tname>Panomya arctica Lamarck</tname> Arctic Rough Mya 

Arctic Seas to Chesapeake Bay. 

2 to 3 inches in length, about Y2 as high, squarish in outline. Looks 
somewhat hke a misshapen <tname>Alya</tname>, but lacks teeth and a chondrophore in the 
hinge, and has a coarse, flaky, light-brown periostracum. Characterized by 
oblong or oval, sunk-in muscle and pallial line scars. There are 2 poorly de454 American Seashells 

fined radial ridges near the center of the valves. Common in mud in cold 
waters offshore. 



<tname>Vanomya ampla Dall</tname> Ample Rough Mya 

Aleutian Islands to Puget Sound, Washington. 

2 to 3 inches in length. A peculiarly distorted, heavy shell which is 
much gaping at both ends. Anterior end crudely pointed; posterior broadly 
truncate. With 3 to 6 depressed scars on the white interior. Exterior concentrically roughened, ash-white in color, with a border of thick, irregular, 
black periostracum. Hinge without definite teeth. Uncommon offshore in 
cold water.

<tname>Panope generosa Gould</tname> Geoduck 

(Goo-ee-duck) 
Alaska to the Gulf of California. 

7 to 9 inches in length. Inflated, sHghtly elongate and rather thickshelled. Gaping at both ends. Coarse, concentric, wavy sculpture present,
