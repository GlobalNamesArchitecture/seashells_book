Greenland to Massachusetts. Japan and the Aleutian Islands. 

About I inch in length, oblong to oval, elevated and rather acutely 
angular. Colored a light-tan over which is a heavy suffusion of dark-red

high magnification it is seen to be granulated. Lateral areas of intermediate 
valves not very distinctly outlined. Interior of valves tinted with rose. Posterior valve with 8 to 9 slits. Girdle is leathery and without scales or bristles.

About an inch in length, similar to <tname>T. marjuorea</tname>, but with its valves 
smooth and shiny, and it is brightly painted with black-brown lines bordered 
with white which run obliquely backwards on the intermediate valves. The 
end valves have these same color lines concentrically arranged. Common 
on the rocky shores of Alaska. The young live in waters off the shore 
from 10 to 30 fathoms, but as they mature they migrate toward shore.
