Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

% to I inch in height. Whorls with 3 spiral rows of rather prominent 
bulbous low tubercles. Parietal wall glazed over and ingrained with numerous white dots which are developed into minutely raised pustules. Color 
(with thin, velvety, gray periostracum removed) whitish with specklings or 
mottlings of brown or black-brown. Nucleus papilliform, white or pink. 
Operculum very small, corneous, and with its nucleus on the side. Nocturnal. 
Just below low-tide mark under coral slabs. 

Genus <tname>Vhaliwn Link 1807</tname> 

These are miniature helmet shells which rarely exceed a length of 5 
inches. The Scotch Bonnet of Florida (<tname>Phaliiim grajiulatwn</tname>) is well-known 
to most collectors. This genus differs from <tname>Cassis</tname> in having much smaller 
shells which do not have an extended, upturned siphonal canal and do not 
develop a massive parietal shield. Typical <tname>Fhalium</tname> which has 4 or 5 tiny 
spines on the base of the outer lip (as for example in the Indo-Pacific genotype, <tname>P. glaiicwn Linne</tname>) is not represented in American waters. Our two 
species belong to the subgenus <tname>Seinicassis</tname> which lacks these tiny spines. 
Operculum as in <tname>Cassis</tname>.

1% to 3 inches in length, with about 20 spiral grooves on the body 
whorl. Weak axial ribs sometimes present which make the shell coarsely 
beaded. Lower parietal area pustulose. Outer lip may be greatly thickened 
occasionally. Not uncommonly washed ashore. It is also present on the 
west coast of Central America as the subspecies centiqiiadrata Valenciennes. 
Formerly known as <tname>Semicassis abbreviata Lamarck</tname> and <tname>S. inflatum Shaw</tname>.

Shell i'V2 to 2 inches in length, similar to <tname>P. granulatum</tname> but without 
the spiral grooves; sometimes smaller specimens have nodules on the shoulder 
of the whorl. Rare in Florida. Meuschen named this shell first, but his 
works are now ruled out as invalid. The nodulated, smaller variety was 
named peristephes Pilsbry and McGinty. 

Genus <tname>Cassis Scopoli 1777</tname> 

The helmet shells are large, handsome mollusks which have been used 
by man for centuries. Large numbers of cameos are still cut from them, 
the meat is often used in chowders, and the uncut shells serve as attractive 
doorstops or mantel-pieces. In the Pacific, they are sliced in half and the 
body whorl used either as a cooking container or boat-bailer. The half dozen 
known species are found only in the West Indies and Indo-Pacific area. They 
live in moderately deep water and although sometimes are obtained in kneedeep waters, they usually must be dived for in 10 to 20 feet of water. The
