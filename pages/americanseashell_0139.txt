San Diego to Lower California. 

About 3 mm. in length, usually with 18 to 24 moderately developed, 
evenly spaced, rounded or squarish, axial rings. Lip of aperture usually heavily developed in adults. Color tan. The number of raised rings varies from 
specimen to specimen, often in the same locality, and diligent search will 
usually bring to light any number desired. Extremes have been unwisely 
named (15 rings — <tname>C. grippi Bartsch</tname>; 17 to 19 rings — <tname>C. licalum Bartsch</tname>; and 
19 to 22 rings — <tname>C. diegense Bartsch</tname>). Figure 37h is the holotype.
