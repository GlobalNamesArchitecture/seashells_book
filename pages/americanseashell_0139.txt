San Diego to Lower California. 

About 3 mm. in length, usually with 18 to 24 moderately developed, 
evenly spaced, rounded or squarish, axial rings. Lip of aperture usually heavily developed in adults. Color tan. The number of raised rings varies from 
specimen to specimen, often in the same locality, and diligent search will

19 to 22 rings — C. diegense Bartsch). Figure 37h is the holotype.
