<tname>ACMAEIDAE</tname> 103 

I to 1% inches in maximum diameter, elliptical to almost round in outline, low to quite flat. Characterized by radial rows of small beads which 
sometimes may be crowded together to form tiny, rough riblets. Exterior 
greenish black. Interior glossy-white, younger specimens having a blue tint. 
Patch of brown on inside generally weak or absent. Edge of shell usually with 
solid, black-brown, narrow band. Occasional albinos are cream-brown or tan 
on the outside. Compare with <tname>A. scutum</tname> which is smooth and has a barred 
band of color on its under edge. 

<tname>Ac77mea digitalis Eschscholtz</tname> Fingered Limpet 

Plate i8f 

Aleutian Islands to Socorro Island, Mexico. 

1% inch in maximum diameter, elliptical in outline; generally with a 
moderately high apex which is minutely hooked forward and which is placed 
Vz back from the anterior end of the shell. The 15 to 25 moderately developed, coarse, radiating ribs give the edge of the shell a slightly wavy border. 
Color grayish with tiny, distinct mottlings of white dots and blackish streaks 
and lines. Inside white with faint bluish tint and with a large, usually even, 
patch of dark-brown in the center. Edge of shell v/ith a solid or broken, 
narrow band of black-brown. Common. Do not confuse this species with 
<tname>A. scabra</tname> which does not have the "hooked-forward" apex and is not glossy 
on its internal brown patch. Compare also with persona. 

<tname>Acmaea persona Eschscholtz</tname> Mask Limpet 

Plate i8q 

Aleutian Islands to Monterey, California. 

I to 1% inches in maximum diameter, with characters much the same 
as those of digitalis, but differing in being smoothish, larger, often slightly 
higher, and in having a strong tint of blue or blue-black inside. I am inclined 
to believe that Pilsbry is correct in considering digitalis as a smaller, ribbed 
form of persona, despite the fact that recent workers place these two species 
in different subgenera. It is possible that colder waters allow the smooth 
persona form to express itself. The Mask Limpet is very common from 
Monterey north. It is an intertidal dweller where strong waves flush the rock 
crevices. It feeds mostly during the ebb tide and is more active during dark 
hours. The small southern subspecies, <tlawname>strigatella Carpenter</tlawname>, is about H inch 
in size, dark gray-blue inside, and externally with a mass of intertwining or 
joining radial bars of brown on a bluish or gray-white background.

I % inch in maximum diameter, elliptical in outline, generally with a low 
apex which is placed % back from the front end. The 15 to 25 strong, coarse 
radiating ribs give the edge of the shell a strong crenulation. Color dirty 
gray-green. Underside of shell whitish, irregularly stained in the center with 
blackish brown. Edge of shell between the serrations is stained blackish to
