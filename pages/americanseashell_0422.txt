% to I inch in length, elongate, moderately pointed at the posterior 
lower corner. Surface white with iridescent sheen and with fine concentric 
threads or grooves. These fade out at the posterior fourth of the shell, but 
reappear more coarsely on the very posterior slope. There is a well-formed, 
radial rib inside just behind the anterior muscle scar. Common in certain 
sandy localities from shore to 25 fathoms. It appears that T. buttoni Dall is 
the same species.
