North Carolina to Florida, Texas and the West Indies. 

I to iVo inches in length, ovate, compressed, white or flushed with 
bright-orange. Concentric ridges moderately sharp, usually unequally spaced. 
Ligament partially visible from the outside. Lunule strongly raised into a 
rather thin, rough blade. Anterior and posterior lateral tooth strong. Cardinals very weak. Moderately common in shallow water. Alias <tname>Lucina jamaicensis Lamarck</tname>. Do not confuse with <tname>P. filosus</tname>.

North Carolina to Florida, Texas and the Bahamas. 

V^ inch in length, almost circular, inflated, strong and pure white. Sculpture of strong, closely spaced, concentric and radial ribs. These form a 
reticulate, rough surface. Where the ribs cross each other there is a tiny, 
raised scale. The ventral margin of the valve is strongly beaded by the distal 
ends of the axial riblets. Common in shallow water to 100 fathoms.

Santa Barbara, California, to Manzanillo, Mexico. 

I inch in length, circular, moderately inflated and with a fine, sharp, 
cancellate sculpturing. The shell is divided off^ at the anterior and upper 
portion into a slightly more compressed region which is less sculptured concentrically. Lunule very deep, short and larger in the left valve. Moderately 
common offshore in sand.

Newfoundland to north Florida and the Gulf States. 

1 to 3 inches in length (south of North Carolina rarely over i ^ inches) , 
almost circular, compressed, white, with a thin, yellowish periostracum. 
Beaks small, close together and centrally located. Sculpture of sharp, raised, 
thin, concentric ridges each about % inch apart. The young commonly lack 
these ridges. No anterior lateral tooth present. Common offshore. Do not 
confuse with pectinatiis which has a strong anterior lateral tooth, is tinted 
inside with orange and whose concentric ridges are unevenly spaced.
