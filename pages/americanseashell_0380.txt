threads. The shell commonly continues growth after a long rest, thus causing an irregular, concentric hump in the shell. Inner margin very finely 
denticulate. <tname>P. crenella Dall</tname> is the same species. Common from beach to 
1 20 fathoms. 

<tname>Lucina tenuisculpta Carpenter</tname> Fine-lined Lucina 

Figure ySh 

Bering Sea to Lower California. 

V2 inch in length, slightly less in height, oval in outline, chalky-white 
and with a thin, grayish or yellowish green periostracum. Sculpture of numerous, small, weak, raised, radial threads. Concentric growth lines fine and 
irregularly placed. Beaks fairly prominent and pressed closely together. Behind them, the narrow, depressed ligament is visible from the outside. In 
front is the small, heart-shaped, depressed lunule. Inner margin of valves 
finely toothed. Common just offshore.

Figure ySg 

Monterey, California, to Panama. 

M inch or less in size. Very similar to tenuisculpta, but smaller, almost 
round in outline, more inflated and with fewer and quite strong, radial riblets. Periostracum very thin, commonly worn off. Shell texture less chalky. 
Common in sandy mud just offshore to 48 fathoms.

North CaroHna to southeast Florida and the Bahamas. 

Vi inch in length, roughly oval, fairly thick-shelled, inflated and white 
in color. With 4 conspicuous, large, rounded, radial ribs, and with numerous, 
small, crowded, squarish, concentric riblets. The inner margins of the valves 
are finely denticulate. A common, bizarrely sculptured species found from 
low water to several fathoms.

West coast of Florida to Texas. 



388 American Seashells 

1/4 inches in length, almost circular, compressed, smoothish, except for 
a few weak, irregular growth lines. Pure-white with a dull- whitish, flaky 
periostracum. The beaks point forward, and in front of them there is a deep, 
small pit. Hinge plate fairly wide and strong, but the teeth are weakly defined. Moderately common in shallow water to a few fathoms. 

Genus <tname>Phacoides Gray 1847 </tname>

Shell orbicular, quite compressed. Sculpture mostly concentric. Cardinal teeth obsolete in adults, but the laterals are well-developed. <tname>Phacoides 
Blainville</tname> is the same but is not considered valid. <tname>Dentilucina Fischer </tname>is the 
same.
