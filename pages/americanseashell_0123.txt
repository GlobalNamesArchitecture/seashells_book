% to I inch in length, very similar to <tname>N. tessellata</tname>, but with a lightercolored, yellowish gray operculum. The spiral ridges on the shell are more 
numerous, the color patterns blurred, the aperture relatively wider, and the 
teeth more prominent. This is a salt to brackish-water inhabitant of protected shores, and is abundant only in certain restricted localities. It is 
seldom represented or properly labeled in private collections.
