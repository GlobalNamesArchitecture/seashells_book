of grayish green and grayish white. Posterior valve with minutely pimpled 
ribs. Lateral areas of middle valves with 6 to 8 rows of small beads between 
which are microscopic pinholes. Central areas smoothish, with fine, transverse 
scratches. Common. 

<tname>Chiton viridis Spengler</tname> from the West Indies is very similar, but the 
margins of the central areas have 6 to 1 1 very short, wavy ribs, and the 
lateral areas have 3 or 4 strong ribs of rounded pustules. Uncommon.

narrow slits. Sutural plates on underside of middle valves with a dark blotch 
at the base. Common. 

<tname>Chiton albolineatus Sowerby</tname> (western Mexico, uncommon) is also a 
smooth species, but differs in having only 16 to 17 slits in the posterior 
valve and has snow-white, radiating lines on the lateral areas and on the 
end valves. The girdle scales are light blue-green and edged with white.

End valves with rather even, raised, radiating threads. Middle valves with 
the lateral areas bearing about 8 raised threads which split in two at the margin 
of the valve. Central area with about 6o to 70 even, longitudinal threads. 
Posterior valve with 19 to 20 prominent slits. Common. The closely resembling species, <tname>C. stokesi Broderip</tname>, from Mexico to West Colombia has 
only 15 to 16 slits in the posterior valve.
