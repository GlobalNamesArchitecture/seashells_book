Family SIPHON ARllDAE 
Genus Siphonaria Sowerby 1824 

Shells closely resembling the true limpets, Acmaea, but at once distinguished by the nature of the muscle scars on the inside. In both, the long, 
narrow scar is horseshoe-shaped, but in Siphonaria the gap between the ends 
is located on one side of the shell, while in Acmaea it is located at the front 
end. In some Siphonaria, the area near the gap is trough-shaped. These 
are air-breathers and are more closely related to the land garden snails than 
to the gill-bearing, water-breathing limpets.
