helmet shells are carnivorous and include the spiny sea urchins in their diet. 
Operculum semicircular, corneous and concentric. 

<tname>Cassis tuberosa Linne</tname> King Helmet 

Southeast Florida and the West Indies. 

Adults 4 to 9 inches in length, massive, with a finely reticulated sculpture. Color brownish cream with black-brown patches on the lip and a 
large patch of brown at the center of the parietal shield. This species may 
be easily confused with the Flame Helmet (<tname>Cassis fiaminea Linne</tname>) which 
occurs in the Bahamas and Antilles. The latter lacks the reticulated sculpture, 
lacks brown color between the teeth on the outer lip, has a rounded (not 
triangular) parietal shield and is from 3 to 5 inches in length. Rare in Florida 
(10 fathoms), common to the south in shallow water.

Plate 23V 

Southeast Florida, the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. 



194 American Seashells 

Adults 4 to 9 inches in length, massive. Three spiral rows of large blunt 
spines; the topmost spine of the first row generally the largest. Color palecream on the outer surface. Parietal shield and outer lip pale- to deep-salmon. 
Teeth white, brown sometimes between them. Moderately common from 
5 to 10 fathoms in the Bahamas. Very rare in Florida where it is replaced 
by the Clench's Helmet, the subspecies spinella Clench. 

<tname>Cassis madagascariensis spinella Clench</tname> Clench's Helmet 

Off Beaufort, North Carolina (fossil?), and the Florida Keys. 

Similar to the typical madagascariensis, but with numerous small, evenly 
sized spines, more noticeable on the top row. Frank Lyman has collected 
this novel form or subspecies by the dozen in 20 feet of water off the Florida 
Keys. It is not a rarity and has been in old collections for many years. We 
have seen specimens labelled as coming from the Bimini Islands, Bahamas, 
but the record needs confirmation.

<tname>Cypraecassis testiculus Linne</tname> Reticulated Cowrie-helmet 

Plate 9c 

Southeast Florida, Bermuda and the West Indies. 

I to 3 inches in length. Body whorl closely sculptured by small, distinct, 
longitudinal ridges which are crossed by a dozen or so spiral grooves, thus 
producing a reticulated surface. The shoulder of the body whorl in a very 
few specimens may have pinched-up, low tubercles or ribs. It is only a 
form. Entire animal light brownish orange, with underside of foot smeared 
with darker shades of orange. No periostracum. No operculum. Eggs laid 
under small rocks in greenish-brown clusters of 100 or so, teardrop-shaped, 
translucent capsules. Reef inhabitant, below low-water level.
