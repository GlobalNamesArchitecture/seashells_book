Key to the Atlantic Species 
(To determine on which side of the apical perforation the lip arises, 
hold the shell with the apex toward you and the apertural lip facing to the 
right.) 

a. Apertural lip arising on the left side of the perforation, and angled near 
its insertion: 

b. Shell with numerous fine spiral grooves; % inch; yellowish to 
whitish; southeast Florida and the West Indies . elegans Gray 

bb. Shell smooth; % inch; West Indies .... glabra A. Adams 

aa. Apertural lip arising on right side; not angled: 

c. Well-grooved spirally: 

d. Sides of whorls globose; % inch; amber to whitish; Cape Cod 

to North Carolina; common solitaria Say (pi. 26s) 

dd. Sides of whorls flattish; % to V2 inch, translucent-white; west 

Florida to Texas; common succinea Conrad 

cc. Spiral striae absent or excessively fine; % inch; translucent greenish 
yellow; globose; Gulf to West Indies . antillarum Orbigny 

Pacific Coast Species 
Haminoea virescens Sowerby Sowerby's Paper-bubble 

Puget Sound to Mexico. 

Yo inch in length, very fragile, a translucent greenish yellow in color. 
Aperture very large and open. Upper part of outer lip high and narrowly 
winged. No apical hole. A common, littoral species on the open coast. 
H. cy?7ibi^orviis Cpr. and H. olgae Dall are the same. 

Haminoea vesicida Gould Gould's Paper-bubble 

Alaska to the Gulf of California. 

% inch in length, very fragile, similar to virescens, but with a barrelshaped whorl (from an apertural view), proportionately smaller aperture, 
with a tiny apical perforation, and with a lower, more rounded wing on the 
upper part of the outer lip. Shell color much the same, but the thin periostracum is often rusty-brown or yellowish orange. A common, littoral
