<tname>Cavolina micinata Rang</tname> Uncinate Cavoline 

Figure 64X 

Worldwide, pelagic. (40° N. to 40° S.)6 to 7 mm. in length. Dorsal lip with a thin margin. Ventral lip not 
more developed than the dorsal one. Shell with distinct lateral points. Upper 
lip flattened posteriorly. <tname>C. iincinati^ormis Pfeffer</tname> is a synonym. 

<tname>Cavolina inflexa Lesueur</tname> Inflexed Cavoline 

Figure 641 

Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. (41° N. to 42° S.). 

6 to 7 mm. in length, similar to uncinata, but the upper Hp is directed 
straight forward, instead of flattened posteriorly; and the ventral side of the 
shell is weakly, instead of strongly, convex. <tname>C. labiata Orb.</tname>, <tname>C. imitans Pfeffer</tname> 
and <tname>C. elongata Blainville</tname> are this species. 

Subgenus <tname>Diacria Gray 1842</tname> 

Similar to Cavolina s.s., but the dorsal lip of the shell is thickened into 
a pad, and not thin as the true Cavoline is. Some workers use this as a genus. 

<tname>Cavolina trispinosa Lesueur</tname> Three-spined Cavoline 

Figure 641 

Worldwide, pelagic. (60° N. to 41° S.). 

About 1 1 mm. in length. Dorsal lip thickened into a pad. Shell with a 
long lateral spine on each side, and a very long terminal one. Aperture 
scarcely discernible. Ventral side of shell very slightly convex. <tname>C. mucronata Q. and G.</tname>, <tname>C. cuspidata Delle Chiaje</tname> and <tname>C. reeviana Dunker</tname> are this 
species. Very common. 

<tname>Cavolina quadridentata Lesueur</tname> Four-toothed Cavoline 

Figure 64s 

Worldwide, pelagic. (36° N. to 28° S.). 

2 to 4 mm. in length. Dorsal lip thickened into a pad. Without prominent lateral spines. Aperture well-developed. Ventral side greatly inflated. 
Upper lip longer than the bottom one. <tname>C. inermis Gould</tname>, <tname>C. inimita Sowerby</tname>, 
<tname>C. intermedia Sowerby</tname> and <tname>C. costata Pfefi^er</tname> are synonyms. Quite common. 

Genus <tname>CitvierivLt Boas 1886</tname> 

Shell cylindrical, shaped somewhat like a fat cigar. Surface smooth. A 
cross-section is almost circular. Behind the aperture the shell is slightly con<tname>DORIDAE</tname> 299 

stricted. There is only one species in the genus. The genera <tname>Cuvieria Rang</tname> 
and <tname>Herse Gistel 1848</tname> (non Oken 181 5) are synonyms. 

<tname>Cuvierina columnella Rang</tname> Cigar Pteropod
