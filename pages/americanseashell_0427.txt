centric sculpture of fine, irregular threads. Periostracum remaining on the 
margins is gray. Pallial sinus in left valve runs from the posterior muscle 
scar anteriorly toward the anterior muscle scar, but does not meet the 
latter, and then descends posteriorly to meet the pallial line about the middle 
of the lower margin of the shell. A common cold-water species, distinguished 
from balthica by its larger size, more elongate shape and pattern of the pallial 
sinus scar (see fig, 88g).

% to 1/4 inches in length, oval, moderately compressed. Color dull 
whitish, in some with a flush of pink, and with a thin, grayish periostracum 
which readily flakes off. The shape is somewhat variable. A common intertidal and deep-water species. Compare muscle scars with those of calcarea.

/4 to % inch in length, fragile, elongate, white in color with a delicate 
iridescence on the smooth exterior. Posterior and narrower end slightly 
twisted to the left. This small, tellin-like species is very common in shallow 
water in sand. <tname>M. soiileyetiana Recluz</tname> is the same. 

<tname>Macoma limiila Dall</tname> is very similar in size and shape, although somewhat 
more elongate, and is distinguished by the finely granular external surface 
of the valves. Commonly dredged from North Carolina to Florida.
