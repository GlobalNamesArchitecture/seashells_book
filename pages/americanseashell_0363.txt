are welded together to form a single rib. In cross-section, this would give 
the rib the shape of the letter M. Hinge-line straight with one ear slightly 
shorter than the other. Color dull-gray with indistinct blotches of dullpink. Uncommonly dredged off Miama and the Lower Keys.

Florida Keys to the Lesser Antilles. 

1 to 2 inches in size, ears about equal. Valves moderately inflated. Surface highly glossy, the colored valve with about 18 very low, rounded ribs. 
Bottom valve white. Top valve rosy-tan with characteristic, numerous small, 
wavy, thin lines of pink-brown running concentrically. A few brown mottlings may be present. A very gorgeous and rare species dredged from 7 
to 50 fathoms.<tname> A. may aguezensis Dall and Simpson</tname> is this species.

North Carolina to both sides of Florida and the West Indies. 

% to I ^ inches in size, both valves inflated and fairly deep. Hinge-ears 
equal to the width of the main part of the shell. 18 to 20 ribs, the center 
part of each bearing prominent, erect, concave scales, and on each side 2 
rows of much smaller scales. Color orange-brown, red, lemon-yellow, 
orange, or commonly mottled with purple. Beach-worn specimens may 
lose most of their scaliness. Moderately common just offshore to 90 fathoms. 
Formerly called exasperatus Sby. and fusco-purpureus Conrad.

coast. It is not a very colorful species, although its drab browns and grays 
are rarely enhvened with yellow. There are 3 distinct subspecies which 
previously have been little understood. Each has a distinct geographical 
range and peculiar habitat. 

<tname>A. irradians irradians Lamarck</tname>. Nova Scotia to Long Island, N.Y. 17 to 
18 ribs which are low and roundish in cross-section. Each valve is about 
the same fatness, and the lower one is only slightly lighter in color. Drab 
gray-brown with indistinct, darker-brown mottlings. The most compressed 
of the 3 subspecies. This is borealis Say. 

<tname>A. irradians concentricus Say</tname>. New Jersey (rare), Virginia to Georgia 
and Louisiana to Tampa, Florida. 1 9 to 21 ribs which are squarish in crosssection. Lower valve (the lightest in color and commonly all white) is 
much fatter than the dull bluish gray to brown upper valve. Common. 

<tname>A. irradians ajnplico status Dall</tname> (fig. i6i). Central Texas to Mexico 
and Colombia. Similar to concentricus, but with only 12 to 17 ribs; more 
gibbose; lower valve commonly white and with high, squarish to slightly 
rounded ribs. Common in Texas.
