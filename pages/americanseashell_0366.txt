North Carolina to both sides of Florida and the West Indies. 

% to I inch in height, elongate, fragile, semi-translucent, white, with a 
large posterior gape and with a long, narrow anterior gape. Radial ribs small, 
fine, uneven in size and distribution. Hinge-ears almost equal in length. 
Closely related to <tname>L. Mans Gmelin</tname> from Europe. A fairly common species 
which is often misidentified in collections as <tname>L. inflata Lamarck</tname> (not Gmelin) . 
<tname>L. antillensis Dall</tname> is the same. In thicker and older specimens there is a small, 
pinhole depression in the hinge just off to one side of the ligamental area.

I to 3 inches in height, half as long. Sculpture coarse, consisting of irregular, radial rows of short, bar-like ribs, somewhat giving the appearance 
of shingles on a roof. Periostracum thin, dark- to light-brown. A common 
variation of this species (form tenera Sowerby) is startlingly different, in 
that the small radial ribs are much more numerous and much smaller (pi. 
35h), Common under rocks in shallow water at low tide.

Monterey, California, to Mexico. 

I inch in length, white, obliquely elliptical in shape. With fine, irregular, radial ribs which are crossed by very fine, rough threads. Anterior and

Greenland to Puerto Rico. Alaska to Mexico. 

% inch in height, ovate-oblong, greatly inflated (having the shape of 
the shell of a pistachio nut), and sculptured with numerous small, longitudinal riblets. On the inside of the valves there are 2 prominent, longitudinal
