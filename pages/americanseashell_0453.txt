I inch in length; valve truncate at the posterior end. There is a very 
characteristic, elevated, triangular area which radiates from the beaks to the 
large, posterior end. This area is crossed by strong, transverse lamellations 
resembling a washboard. Commonly found boring in soft coral rock. Uncommon in Florida.

Pending publication of the extensive researches on this group by Dr. 
Ruth D, Turner at Harvard University, we are dividing the groups in this 
family and treating the species in the conventional manner.

4 to 8 inches in length, moderately fragile; pure white in color, but in 
life covered by a thin, gray periostracum. With about 30 well-developed, 
beaded radial ribs which are scale-like at the anterior end of the valve. In 
fresh material, there is a shelly accessory plate over the hinge area. It is 
somewhat triangular and with complicated furrows. The internal brace 
under the beaks is spoon-shaped and with a narrow, strongly hooked attached end. Common in sticky mud about a foot under the surface (consult "Diggin' 'Em Out" by B. R. Bales, The Nautilus, vol. 59, pp. 13 to 17). 
Some colonies have shells which have pink, concentric stains on the inside of

the valves. No scientific study has been made of this variant, but it may be 
due to environmental or dietetic conditions.
